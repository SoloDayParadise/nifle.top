In-game top-ups will be available during the testing period, and all spending will be rebated according to the rules outlined below. Please read carefully to ensure you can claim your rewards correctly at launch.\n\n<Title>Top-Up Rebate Rules</>\n1. All top-up amounts during the Second Closed Beta Test will be rebated in the official launch version at a fixed rate of: <highlight>¥1 = 10 Phoxene Plumules</>.\n① For the portion of your total top-up amount <highlight>up to ¥2,000</>, you will receive <highlight>200%</> of the equivalent value in Phoxene Plumules.\n② For the portion <highlight>from ¥2,001 to ¥5,000</>, you will receive <highlight>150%</>.\n③ For any portion <highlight>exceeding ¥5,000</>, you will receive <highlight>128%</>.\n※ If the calculated rebate includes a decimal, it will be rounded up to the nearest whole number.\nExample: \nIf a player tops up ¥6,000 during the test, the rebate will be calculated as:\n(¥2,000×10×200%)+(¥3,000×10×150%)+(¥1,000×10×128%) = 97,800 Phoxene Plumules\n\n2. Players who purchase <highlight>Lunotress's Monthly Pass</> during the Second Closed Beta Test will receive, in addition to the Phoxene Plumule rebate outlined above, an equivalent subscription duration for free upon the game's official launch. <highlight>A maximum of two purchases will be rebated</>, for a total of 60 days of benefits. Please note that the avatar frame included with the Monthly Pass is exclusive to the beta and will not carry over.\nExample: \nIf a player purchases two Monthly Passes (¥60 total), they will receive:\n¥60×10×200% = 1,200 Phoxene Plumules, plus 60 days of Monthly Pass benefits at launch.\n\n3. Purchases of the following items during the Second Closed Beta Test will be counted towards your total top-up amount and rebated accordingly: Standard Battle Passes, Premium Battle Passes, Battle Pass Upgrade Packs, Top-up Gift Packs, Skins, and top-up amounts made via recharge tiers. Corresponding Phoxene Plumule rebates will be issued based on the rules in Section 1 above. Please note that <highlight>all bonus items included in these purchases are for test use only and will not carry over to the official launch</>.\nExample: \nIf a player tops up ¥328 via the recharge tier, plus purchases gift pack [XXX] and a Premium Battle Pass, the total spend would be: ¥328+¥XXX+¥128 = ¥XXX\n→ At launch, they will receive: ¥XXX×10×[rebate rate]% = [rebated amount] Phoxene Plumules.\n\n※ During the Second Closed Beta Test, players can view their projected rebate via: \n[Event Centre] → [Rebate Preview for the Second Closed Beta Test]\n\n<Title>Rebate Delivery</>\n1. Rebate rewards will be delivered via in-game mail. Please log in using <highlight>the same account used for top-ups during the test</>, and ensure the in-game mail function is enabled to receive your rebate.\n2. Top-ups made via the official account system can only be claimed by logging in through that system after launch. Top-ups made via the bilibili account system can only be claimed by logging in with the same bilibili account. (Clients downloaded from the official website, TapTap, or Haoyou Kuaibao (3839) use the official account system. Clients downloaded from the bilibili Game Centre use the bilibili account system.)\n3. Account data will be shared across PC, iOS, and Android during both the beta and official launch.\n4. Players must log in within 365 days of the official launch to claim their rebate via in-game mail. <highlight>The rebate mail will expire after this period</>. Please ensure you claim it in time.",

  "NpcBiography_Information_Anuo": "Arnaud is, in some ways, one of the fortunate ones — growing up safely in an orphanage as a Charon child is a rare stroke of luck. But in other ways, he is deeply unfortunate — when the orphanage became overcrowded, he was cast out, left to fend for himself while still a child.\n \nCharons are known for their resilience, but even their hardy nature can't protect a child from the deathly cold nights of Icelake. Once out on his own, Arnaud has spent countless hours strategising on how to survive the bitter cold of the night.\n \nWith his few possessions, Arnaud managed to scrape together some goods to sell outside the theatre to make ends meet, but business has been slow — the townsfolk of Icelake show little interest in the arts. There is one exception — a pompous nobleman who frequents the theatre. Arnaud has a somewhat positive impression of him. This nobleman consistently supports Arnaud's small venture and intriguingly, has never bought any fermented drinks. Driven by curiosity, Arnaud once asked him about it. The nobleman, through elaborate explanations, shared that he had a severe intolerance to alcohol — even a mere touch on his lips could induce an unintended slumber.\n \nWith this loyal patron's support, Arnaud managed to scrape by until this brutally cold winter made survival even more challenging. His meagre savings are insufficient to purchase the necessary fuel to keep warm. A daring idea then took root in his desperate mind...\n \nOne evening, he followed the nobleman home and slipped through a window left slightly ajar. Inside, the nobleman's residence was modest for his rank — no servants were in sight, and the hearth was barely warm. Yet, compared to the icy streets, it was a sanctuary. \n \nArnaud tiptoed into the kitchen and spiked the kettle with a bit of alcohol, then waited patiently for the nobleman to return from the theatre and take a sip. Once the nobleman fell deeply asleep, Arnaud could finally bask in the warmth of the fire...",
  "NpcBiography_Information_Bake": "Mr Buck is a man whose speech and demeanour are as poetic as the verses he adores, with a deep-seated passion for literature and art that pervades every aspect of his life. While it's natural for people to indulge in what brings them joy, but in Mr Bark's case, this passion has become somewhat of an obsession.\n \nAs a lordling from a declining noble line, Mr Buck has just enough inheritance to keep himself fed and sheltered. The regulars at the local tavern often jest that without it, Mr Buck's penchant for flowery prose and lack of practical skills would inevitably lead him to a life under a bridge.\n \nIt's a fair observation. Even in his beloved realm of creative writing, Mr Buck has struggled to leave a mark. His scripts, submitted with a hopeful heart to the Hegon Theater, have yet to grace the stage — and likely never will. Thus, Mr Buck spends his days lingering forlornly outside the theatre, reciting verses that echo the melancholy of autumn and the slow descent of leaves.\n \nRecently, Mr Buck has been pouring his soul into crafting a new tragedy, one enveloping themes of moonlight, graves, separated lovers, regrets, and the sombre intertwining of love and death. Perhaps overinvested in his work or wearied by the theatre's constant rejection, he has grown increasingly paranoid. He insists that he hears footsteps and detects odd scents in his room, oddities that coincide with mysterious bouts of deep sleep that steal away his creative nights.\n \nDespite these disturbances, Mr Buck hasn't actually lost anything of tangible value — arguably, his enforced regular sleep might even be seen as a positive development, given his otherwise nocturnal toils. Nonetheless, he is agitated, fervently seeking assistance to expose this \"Inspiration Stealer\", as he puts it. Yet, his appeals are largely ignored, dismissed as the ramblings of a man offering little in the way of cash reward. He claims his play will one day triumph in the capital's most prestigious theatre and offers that in his next masterpiece, he will immortalise the name of anyone who helps to catch the thief. Sadly, no one buys it.",
  "NpcBiography_Information_Beilinda": "Belinda has erected her modest tent in a shabby back alley. There, she offers solace to downtrodden Charons by channelling messages from their departed loved ones, offering guidance for their future paths. It's not uncommon for many Charons to spend whole afternoons in her tent, sharing their woes as Belinda, with her grandmotherly warmth, offers them comfort for next to nothing. This scant income keeps her life simple and frugal.\n \nBelinda is always adorned with an assortment of homemade trinkets. Her nimble fingers transform discarded bits of glass, wire, and fabric into delicate artefacts.

  "NpcBiography_Information_Dadun": "Dutton, a sewage worker enveloped in a perpetual stench.\nIn his early thirties, many in his birthplace would respectfully refer to him as Doctor Dutton, a source of pride for the local elders. He once attempted to save a pedestrian who fell ill on the street. But tragically, the effort failed, and he was faced with a colossal compensation claim that led to his dismissal from the hospital.\nLife has its cruel jests. Dutton, once a healer of people, found no decent work beyond his medical skills and eventually descended into the sewers. \"I used to patch up people, and now I patch up pipes. Not much difference, eh?\" he quips.\nBut no one sees the many nights he's jolted awake by nightmares, clutching his broken stethoscope as a sole comfort to soothe him back to sleep.",

This trick of the trade had him in cahoots with every tavern owner in town, without exception — until he met Camilla.\n\nMoney wasn't the issue for Dean, yet The Asphodel was the missing piece in his empire of adulteration, a niggling gap he was hell-bent on closing. After all, not just the tavern owners, but all boozers in Icelake were hooked on his cut-price tipple. Just a bit of discomfort for half the cost – why not?\n\nThe vendors are happy, the customers are happy, and Dean's happy — a clear-cut case of a triple win. So why on earth wouldn't Camilla come on board?!\n\nThat's a riddle Dean might never fathom.",

  "NpcBiography_Information_Laina": "Lina, a middle-aged woman of unshakable composure, seems untouched by the turmoil of the world.\n \nAfter fifteen years as a maid in the ducal palace of the capital, Lina was on the cusp of a promotion to head housekeeper. Yet, she chose to walk away at the height of her career and start anew in Icelake.\n \nNow, Ms Lina makes her living as a freelance housekeeper, providing top-notch, impartial service to anyone in need. She provides extensive services — from daily household chores and meal preparation to organising large banquets, caring for the disabled and elderly, and even managing sensitive tasks like body preparation, property rentals, pre-arranging gravesites, workers' compensation filings, and cremation arrangements. Despite frequent solicitations from local nobles who crave the opulent services she once rendered in the capital, Lina consistently declines, choosing instead to focus her efforts on aiding those most in need and discreetly supporting the Charon community.\n \nWhat few know is that her decision to leave the ducal household was triggered by an encounter with Henrik.\n \nBack then, Henrik was an itinerant doctor and was invited to consult at the ducal palace. One day, as Lina escorted Henrik back to his lodgings, a Charon collapsed in front of them — a common enough sight in the harsh winter that Lina had grown numb to such tragedies. Unlike her, Henrik immediately rushed to help, asking Lina to fetch some hot water for the stranger.\n \nAs she assisted Henrik in caring for the pale, ailing girl, Lina felt a long-dormant compassion stir within her. She realised that, while her role was meant to be about caring for others, it often reduced her to merely cleaning up after the noble's messes, and her seemingly superior status and living conditions didn't seem to be worth it anymore. Working alongside someone with a heart of gold like Henrik, she felt deeply ashamed.\n \nThroughout Henrik's stay, Lina assisted him with his patients as much as she could, yearning to break free from the guilt that weighed on her, yet struggling to fully commit to change. Henrik, perceiving her inner conflict, did not probe further; instead, he left her with an address in Icelake as he departed, suggesting that should she seek a place of refuge and purpose, she would find it there.\n \nThat place is now known to all as the Hypnos' House.",

Driven to despair, he and his miner buddies picked up their pickaxes one last time, spending their final coins on a few loaves of coarse rye bread before vanishing into the depths of the now-abandoned pit.\nA few weeks ago, Larry reemerged alone in Icelake, lugging a heavy sack of Phoxene.

Despite the traumatic loss of her voice, Luna remains unrepentant about the views she expressed.

But Theo, ever the little sceptic, decided to find out for himself.\nAfter some cautious observation from a (very safe) distance, he eventually settled on his first research subject: {nickname}.

  "QuestDesc_10030212": "The Legion promised to send an escort — but when you arrive, there's no one in sight. Instead, the walls are riddled with bullet holes, evidence of a fierce firefight. It seems the soldiers stationed here crossed paths with the culprit. Since you're heading out anyway, best follow the trail and see where it leads.",
  "QuestDesc_10030213": "You discover a tunnel likely used by the attacker during their escape. It leads all the way to the sewer's outer exit. Move in carefully.",
  "QuestDesc_10030214": "A heavy, uneasy stillness hangs in the air near the sewer's end. Something clearly happened here. Stay alert.",
  "QuestDesc_10030215": "The exit is a scene of carnage. Poison traces — not standard issue for Imperial forces — hint at something far darker behind the Charon Hunt. After some discussion, Outsider stays to report to the Legion. You and Snow stick to the plan and head to the hospital to visit Rhythm.",
  "QuestDesc_10030216": "Days later, Rhythm finally wakes from her coma. After you bring her up to speed on everything that happened, she thanks you — and, as a gesture of gratitude, asks you to retrieve a silver seal from her secret base.

  "QuestDesc_100302sp101": "Two civilians have been trapped in the sewers by a monster — likely the Charon Hunt culprit. You're definitely on the right track. The creature's gone for now, so focus on unlocking the gate and getting the civilians to safety.",
  "QuestDesc_100302sp102": "To reactivate the control panel, you'll need to clear the blocked pipes in this area. But the moment the drainage system activates, Filthoids swarm in. Hold them off and protect the civilian!",

  "QuestDesc_10030301": "Back at Rhythm's secret base, you come across the silver seal — along with a few keepsakes from her past. As you sift through them, something shifts: maybe the distance between you was never as great as it seemed. Bring the seal back and hear what she has to say.",
  "QuestDesc_10030302": "To avoid any unnecessary trouble, it's best to cooperate with the 13th Legion's actions in Icelake for now.",
  "QuestDesc_10030303": "The Charon Hunt has entered a new phase. Following Clive's orders, you make your way into the sewers beneath Silverpeace Square. Once there, re-establish contact and await further instructions.",
  "QuestDesc_10030304": "After you finish updating Rhythm about Berry, Commander Lynn of the 13th Legion barges into the ward. She bluntly announces that her unit is taking over the Charon Hunt. Fortunately, she seems unaware of your ties to Sibylle — and even extends an offer to cooperate. Now is not the time to raise suspicions. Best play along for now, and maintain the appearance of cooperation.",
  "QuestDesc_100303sp101": "You've agreed to assist with the Charon Hunt investigation. Wasting no time, Lynn assigns your first task: meet Clive of the 13th Legion outside Icelake and help process the arriving supplies.",
  "QuestDesc_100303sp102": "Several days later, you finally complete the 13th Legion's assignments. But Rhythm doesn't show at the agreed meeting point. Could something have happened? Search the area and make sure she's safe.",
  "QuestDesc_100303sp103": "To help locals whose lives were disrupted by the 13th Legion, Rhythm is gathering essential supplies. As her ally, you offer to assist.",
  "QuestDesc_100303sp104": "Fishing complete. You've got everything the townsfolk need — time to deliver the goods.",
  "QuestDesc_100303sp105": "No sooner have you handed the supplies to Margie than a new order arrives from Clive. Seems the 13th Legion is on the move — head out and report in.",
  "QuestDesc_100303sp201": "Soldiers from the 13th Legion are stationed throughout the sewers, each patrolling their assigned section. The tunnels are thick with tension. Head to the area Clive designated for the Noctoyagers.",

  "QuestDesc_100303sp204": "After a few delays, you finally gain access to the area Clive assigned. Move in quickly.",
  "QuestDesc_100303sp205": "You try reporting back to Clive after surveying the area — but Rhythm's comms terminal fails, cutting the message short. See if you can fix it.",
  "QuestDesc_100303sp206": "The moment the radio comes back online, you learn the perpetrator has broken through the Legion's blockade and is headed your way. Fortunately, Lynn arrives with backup. Now — finish it.",
  "QuestDesc_10030401": "Though the Legion has declared the case closed and returned to the capital in triumph, you and Rhythm know the truth: it's far from over.",
  "QuestDesc_10030402": "Reviewing the clues so far, you suspect the killer had a connection to opera. That eerie tune he hummed may have come from an aria — and identifying it could narrow the search. Rhythm's younger brother, Blues, is an avid opera fan. He left behind a collection of cassette recordings at their secret base. It's a long shot — but worth a try.",
  "QuestDesc_10030403": "Now comes the hard part. Time to put your memory and your ears to the test — one tape at a time.",
  "QuestDesc_10030404": "Hours slip by as you comb through the recordings. Rhythm has stepped out for some air. The search is slow, tedious — and draining. For now, take a break. Go see how she's doing.",
  "QuestDesc_10030501": "There was never any glory in becoming a Laurelled Charon — the title was nothing but bait. What awaited in the inner city was the cold slab of the Alchemy Academy's operating table. Now, as a monster, all you can do is obey.",
  "QuestDesc_10030502": "No longer human. No thoughts. No will. Only the task remains: eliminate the target.",

  "QuestDesc_10030601": "The title of Laurelled Charon is nothing but a cruel ruse. You can't let Rhythm chase a dream spun from deceit. Tell her the truth about the Alchemy Academy... then do what must be done.",
  "QuestDesc_10030602": "At the Galea Theatre, the Silvercandle Carnival is in full swing. The place swirls with masks and outlandish costumes — the perfect veil for a monster like you. Slip through the revelry and find your contact.",
  "QuestDesc_10030603": "Days have passed since the 13th Legion's departure. Rhythm seems to be recovering — if only just — from the loss of Blues. She may still have more to say. Go, and listen.",
  "QuestDesc_10030604": "The Charon Hunt is over. The Forsakens' reach into the Cocytus Region has been cut short. But this is no ending — merely the next quiet before the storm.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus01": "Amid lingering pain and farewells, the long day finally comes to an end.\nSleep evades you tonight — perhaps a quiet walk through the city will help you clear your mind.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus02": "You learn from Outsider and Snow that you were caught in the Charon Hunt — a string of murders that took place five days ago. Before you can make sense of it all, Rhythm appears unannounced and abruptly ends the conversation. You can't avoid her now — best hear what she has to say.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus03": "You've gathered several promising clues — all possibly linked to the Charon Hunt. When the trail runs cold, try combining them. A new lead might surface.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus04": "You and Rhythm agree to join forces on the Charon Hunt case. First step: comb the scene for clues that could lead to the culprit's whereabouts.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus05": "A row of oversized posters at the theatre entrance immediately catches your eye. They may shed light on recent happenings — worth a look.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus06": "The props master firmly denies that the curtain found at the crime scene came from the Galea Theatre. She claims all items are carefully logged — and a list signed by multiple staff members supports her. Better take a look yourself.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus07": "A tired-looking actor explains the troupe has been rehearsing nonstop for the upcoming Silvercandle Carnival. A nearby attendance sheet records everyone's rehearsal hours — take a look.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus08": "As you finish reviewing the log, a sound from above draws your attention. Go take a look.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus09": "You've arrived at the fishermen's quarters. Time for a proper door-to-door sweep.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus10": "No one answers — but a cat appears behind you, meowing urgently like it's picked up a scent. Might be worth following up.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus11": "You've caught the Phoxichor thief — but he's not the killer. Still, he gives you a lead: the culprit may be hiding in the sewers. Hand him over to the Security Bureau, then regroup with Rhythm to decide your next move.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus12": "With the fisherman handed over, you join Rhythm in the sewers to track the true suspect. Only once you've confirmed their whereabouts can she call for support from the 6th Legion — and bring the Charon Hunt to its end.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus13": "You've secured the civilians — but just as relief sets in, a monstrous roar rises from below. Sounds like the creature they warned you about. Drain the wastewater and continue the pursuit.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus14": "A few days later, Rhythm finally wakes. Bring her up to speed on what happened while she was unconscious.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus15": "You've arrived at Rhythm's hidden base. Search the place — the silver seal bearing her name should be somewhere inside.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus16": "You've arrived at Rhythm's hidden base. Search the place — the silver seal bearing her name should be somewhere inside.",

  "QuestDesc_1003plus18": "You've arrived at the sector Clive assigned to your team. Take a careful look around and assess the surroundings.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus19": "Go over the clues you've gathered — one of them might point to the killer's identity. With fresh eyes, perhaps the missing link will reveal itself.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus20": "Rhythm hums a melody — hauntingly similar to the one the killer sang that night. It's from Children From the Snowfield, a well-known opera. You were just discussing how to use that clue to lure the killer out... but it seems they've come to you first.",

  "QuestDesc_1003plus23": "The Forsakens are yet another looming threat to this city. Eliminate them.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus24": "Just as the battle ends, soldiers from the 13th Legion burst in. If it's a fight they want, then a fight they'll get — none of them are walking away from this.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus25": "You don't know how Rhythm and the Phoxhunters tracked you down — but there's no time to dwell on that. The Legion's still here, and the battle isn't over yet.",
  "QuestDesc_1003plus26": "Your performance as Blues was flawless. Rhythm will never know that she killed her own brother. Neither the 13th Legion nor the Forsakens will trace the bloodshed back to her or the Phoxhunters.\nBut the curtain on that role has fallen. It's time to take the stage one last time — this time, as Parsifal.",

From the wear on the pages, it appears to be a script he studied often — perhaps hoping to one day take the stage himself.)\n\nOn the north-western cape beyond the reach of the Elysian Church, there once stood a duchy called Yashnia, a slender strip of land facing the Hyperborean Empire across the sea. A crossroads of trade and diplomacy, Yashnia balanced precariously between the Church and the Empire — until the Church annexed it more than three centuries ago.\nThough small in size, the duchy endured for generations. Its dukes clung to power through a history steeped in blood: palace intrigue, aulic murders, and political assassinations. In the centuries since, wandering bards have mined Yashnia's crimson legacy for their dramas and ballads. Even the Empire — despite its official ban on the dramatisation of royal assassinations — permits such plays to be performed, viewing them as a fitting indictment of the Church's bloody past.

  "READ_TEXT_2000002": "...\nAll readers know that the author has always lived a solitary life. \nThe benefits of solitude are obvious. Firstly, we can crush and refine precious gems purchased at great expense without hesitation, and without worrying about these valuable materials being used as gifts to win the favour of others. \n(Note: Of course, gems can only fulfil their true value in the hands of an alchemist.)\nSecondly, those who live alone will have more energy to experiment with the wonders of alchemy, rather than feeling deep regret upon finding their first strand of grey hair, and realising that one should not have been overly obsessed with fruitless love like the author. \n(Note: This sounds somewhat extreme, but in today's Empire, who isn't extreme?) \nAnd lastly, maintaining a solitary life can also prevent some unfortunate events from happening, like the following: \nAlong the northern border of the Siberian Empire, there is a city called Icelake (Note: My teacher once went there, supposedly to visit a doctor named Enrique, but unfortunately I didn't inquire further), which produces Crystallo of Stella. It has a cold climate that makes it suitable for conducting research into the fire element. \nAnd the protagonist of this incident? Poor Vagim. He was one of the many alchemists in this region who specialised in the use of fire. He was 40 years old at the time, an age when many alchemists eventually achieved success. However, his greatest achievement at that time was not in alchemy but in having a child who was too clever and had a great interest in alchemy. \n(Annotation: A bit too harsh.)\nOne winter morning, at the insistence of young Igor, Vagim took his son to the alchemy workshop. Naturally, the presence of a child, which are unpredictable, dangerous, and uncontrollable creatures, resulted in an explosive situation in the alchemy workshop. \nThe events that followed were not witnessed by anyone, but based on eyewitness testimonies and an analysis of the scene, it is believed that the following occurred: \nVagim prepared the most materials: Beast Wax, a small amount of Phoxene powder, and a heating crucible. Under his guidance, young Igor followed the classic process and proportions, causing a small and continuously burning fireball to appear in the crucible. \n(Note: This is very basic, but this successful attempt shows that the child had some talent.)\nFor a child, Igor did remarkably well, and Vagim must have thought so too because he instantly praised his son. But unfortunately, this misled the young Igor, who thought that as long as he created a large enough fireball, he would receive even more praise. \nSo, while Vagim was focused on preparing his own experiment, Igor, probably with the intention of surprising his father, added an entire block of Beast Wax to the crucible. \n(Note: Although understandable, this act was completely unforgivable.)\n\nOn that day, Icelake experienced its largest fire since its founding. And the epicenter of the fire was Vagim's workshop. The likely cause was the excessive addition of experimental reactants. Any novice alchemist who had thoroughly read the “Alchemist Safety Guidelines” would not have made such a mistake. However, we cannot blame a child for this. Without a doubt, Vagim was the one responsible for this incident. \nIt can only be said that, as an alchemist, maintaining a solitary life is a virtue that benefits both scientific endeavours and the greater good of society. \n(Note: This is a painful lesson, so I should also be more careful in future.)",

Streams of bullets converged into a formidable fist, thrusting from the ground towards the heavens; explosives rained down like a sudden deluge, spilling from the battlefield into the abyss. \nThe Divine Herald of Elysium, wielding their staff, summoned a beam of light that cleaved through the Legion's ranks.

Acting out of compassion, they brought him into their home and cared for him.\nHowever, Robie Brown was a Deteriorator — one who had evaded the Empire's routine screenings and fled to the outskirts of the city.

  "READ_TEXT_2000053": "Act Ⅰ – Nocturne of the Swans\n\nThe tale opens during the reign of Yushino, third Grand Duke of Yashnia. Long before he inherited the title, Yushino was famed as a patron of the arts — immersed in painting, court verse, and letters. He maintained a grand troupe of dancers, each handpicked by the duke himself. Word of the troupe's brilliance spread so widely that nobles from both the Empire's capital and the Church's seat contrived to serve as envoys, if only to witness one performance in that seaside duchy.\n\nYet when our curtain rises, Yushino does not praise art or boast of his refined taste. Instead he broods over the bane of his sleepless nights: too many siblings. His father, the second Grand Duke, sired more than a hundred sons, and every one of those brothers now covets the throne of so small a state. Whenever Yushino closes his eyes, their faces float before him. He once tried counting them to lull himself to sleep, only to grow more agitated. On the tenth sleepless night, he made a decision.\n\nHe spent ever more time at banquets, drinking heavily in hope of a few hours' oblivion — meagre, but better than none.\nWhen courtiers counselled restraint he waved them off, declaring: \"If anything in this world can grant me rest — be it at a molten mountain's core, in a whirlpool at sea, or flickering on the rim of the sky — I shall possess it.\"\n\nThus, in the first year of his rule, from sunrise to moonset he held feast after feast, inviting his brothers to dine beside him. Pomegranate‑coloured wine never ceased to flow, nor did the dark veins in his bloodshot eyes fade. Beneath the crystal dome, youths in scarlet gauze danced the Swan Dance and sang without pause. Their floating sleeves swept across the nobles' cheeks, leaving them flushed — like clouds blushed by the sun before it sinks beneath the waves.\nAnd each time, the Grand Duke would raise his goblet, wine running into his beard, his smile twisting into something grotesque. Then, catching his brothers in that hazy, entranced moment, he would murmur: \"Would you care to bring one of these sweet-voiced swans home, dear brother?\" And under the spell of wine and swirling dancers — who could refuse such largesse?\n\nThus a thousand swans flew out, one by one, into noble households.\n\nParsifal's Note:\nIn this sequence the ensemble dance is the centrepiece. Redleaf appears here as one among many nameless swans. She must catch the audience's eye — but never so brightly as to break the unity of the dance. That balance is the true challenge.",
  "READ_TEXT_2000054": "Act Ⅱ – Bloodred Meteor Shower\n\nIn the third year of Grand Duke Yushino's reign, nightly revels were no longer confined to his own palace. Every one of his noble brothers had fallen under the spell of Yashnia's sweet‑voiced， graceful swans. Their songs drifted beyond the high walls of noble mansions; even the ragged street children could hum a line or two.\nTo mark the third anniversary of his ascension, Yushino proposed that these long‑scattered swans be gathered at the celebration beneath the palace dome for a single chorus.\nThe courtiers urged caution. The dancers had not sung together in years, they warned; if their harmony faltered before so many guests, ridicule was certain.\nBut Yushino — half‑swallowed by his gilded throne — would not be swayed. In his mind, the voices of the swans and the pulse of his own heart were still one.\n\nThe celebration began as scheduled. Nobles filled the hall. The swan dancers reunited in the centre of the marble floor. Their faces betrayed no joy, no sorrow — for they were swans, trained to sway with the music, to shape their smiles to the tune.\nAt a single, crystal note from Yushino's favourite dancer, a thousand voices rose as one — clear and keen, like lightning splitting the sky. When the last chord fell away, silence descended — like the sea after a storm, so calm it seemed the revelry moments ago had been no more than a dream.\nYushino's brothers drifted into deep, sugared dreams. He watched, envying their peace. Since taking the crown he himself had never slept so soundly.\n\nBut tonight — beneath the bright moonlight — surely even he could find peace.\n\n\"Tatarnaga. Four hundred and ninety‑nine insults against the Grand Duke. Verdict: execution.\"\nThe voice from the throne was ice. One by one, Yushino pronounced the name of the noble who had scorned him most — and the long list of charges, meticulously recorded by the very swan dancer he had gifted Tatarnaga three years before.\nThe dancer who had long kept close company with Tatarnaga stepped forward, her serenity unchanged. A gauzy sleeve brushed the nobleman's cheek, just as on the night they first met. Then — a dull thud. His head, still wearing the soft curve of an intoxicated smile, parted from his body before fear could reach his eyes. It sailed cleanly through the air, trailing a fine red arc — a meteor of flesh and blood. Scarlet rain spattered down, staining the swans' pristine robes.\nThe night was young; the stars were already falling.\n\nYushino barely glanced at the carnage. He seized the hair of the courtier who had doubted the swans' unity and snarled: \"Their loyalty has never broken pitch. Fool. Drink — and be as obedient as they are!\"\nBlood‑dark wine flooded the man's mouth and nose. He choked, certain he would drown.\nThen — to his astonishment — Yushino's grip slackened. The Grand Duke sagged back, and a thunderous snore rolled through the marble hall.\nNever had such a sound echoed in that palace, yet from that night onward it returned at the same hour every evening.\n\n\nParsifal's Note:\nThis scene calls for a solo. Traditionally, Redleaf's sung by a soprano — but I've seen tenors pull it off brilliantly. I'd very much like to try it.",
  "READ_TEXT_2000055": "Act Ⅲ – A Thousand Letters\n\n\"To my most revered, most tenderly pitied, most admired Grand Duke Yushino — you who once spent three sleepless years for the continuance of Yashnia.\nThis is the one thousand and first secret letter I have written to you — in loyalty, and in love. And as in every letter before, I write what I shall gladly write again, and again, and again:\n\nI am forever your docile swan.\nI am forever, forever yours.\nForever and ever and ever.\n\nI imagine that, by the time you read this, a smile must have softened your weary face. One of the courtiers kneeling below your throne would stir at the sound of your laughter and ask what has pleased you so. You'd ignore him, drink half a glass of Hyperborean wine — if you drained it all, it would spill through your beard and stain your robe.\nYou'd sip while you read, deciding whether to finish the drink in peace... or smash it in rage.\n\nYes, I know you. Your face is etched into my heart and soul.\n\nFrom the day you sent me to the Lady's estate, I began to write to you. A thousand letters, sealed with wax and entrusted to birds that knew the way to your hand. \nAnd each time I pressed the seal, I knew exactly what expression you would wear as you read.\n\nBefore the blood‑stained banquet where red meteors rained through the hall, you liked my letters.\nNot just because I was your favourite swan, but because the Lady was unlike your other kin.\nThough the other swans never spoke of it, I knew their noble patrons mocked you in whispers. That was why we were sent into their houses — to gather their sins behind a veil of dance.\nBut the Lady was not like them. She never uttered a word against you.\nShe said you were admirable — for banishing the brother who once mistreated her.\nShe said you were pitiable — for tossing and turning through the night over your nobles' crimes.\nShe said you were brilliant — for wrapping grand designs in feasts and song.\n\nShe spoke of other things, too: of Yashnia's moon, which she saw each night; of Hyperborea's snow, which she had never seen; of Elysium's flowers, which visited only in dreams.\nBut not once did she ask me to dance. Perhaps she had seen too many swan dances in your palace — or perhaps she had never known a real friend.\nI was disheartened. Swans are born to dance — yet I was left to write, with quills plucked from my own wings.\nAnd still, I hoped — that each time you opened one of those harmless little letters, the furrows on your brow would soften.\nAnd perhaps that is why, on the night of that blood‑drenched banquet, she alone walked out beneath the echo of your thunderous snores.\nI followed her out, as she stepped into the dawn. Her breath misted in the cold, her shoulders trembled — fear of you, or joy for your newfound peace? I could not tell. I only felt relief — that she had never once spoken ill of you. If she had, even had I disobeyed your order, the other swans would have torn her apart like ravens at your command.\nFrom that day on, I was the only swan who never returned to your palace.\nOutwardly, nothing changed: she still shared her stories and wishes for travels with me, and every fourth day I sent you another letter.\nBut perhaps... it only seemed that way. Before the sun rises, all is called night. But the midnight of your thunderous snores, and the final breath before dawn — can they truly be the same?\n\nSince then, I imagine you no longer smile when you read me.\nYou buried yourself in state affairs: reforms, punishments, suspicion. You trusted no one in Yashnia who still breathed. Even birdsong was questioned — for daring to disturb your sleep.\nThe Lady was no exception. Her praise became flattery. Her silence, a hidden slight. Her advice, betrayal.\nHow could you?\n\nAllow me to be plain: from my first autumn in her estate, she let me stop calling myself \"swan.\"\nBy now I expect you have hurled your wineglass in rage, Grand Duke Yushino.\nYou saved me from starvation — made me your ever-dancing swan. But she is the one who taught that swan to be a person.\nShe never asked me to dance — because people are not swans.\nTo protect her, I was ever obedient, ever gentle, ever yours. Always fearing your fury would fall on her.\nBut your suspicion grew like mould in the dark. I defended her, again and again. Until seven days ago — when you summoned her to the palace... and she never returned.\nSo now, I ask just one thing:\n\nIs she still alive?\n\nI no longer wish to be anyone's swan. If she is gone, then I shall tread upon the shards of your shattered glass — even if my feet must bleed to reach you — until your blood spills like wine and dyes your robe crimson.\nBy the time you reach this line, I will already be standing before you, ready to pierce this letter — and your throat — with the very same blade.\"\n\n\"Raise your head and answer me, Yushino!\"\n\n\nParsifal's Note:\nExcept for the final line, the entire scene is sung by Yushino as he reads Redleaf's letter aloud. The performance must reflect the full emotional arc within the letter — from deferential restraint, to repressed grief, to seething fury. The true challenge lies in moving seamlessly and convincingly between Yushino's visible reactions and the inner voice of Redleaf, gradually rising to its breaking point. It demands exceptional control.",
  "READ_TEXT_2000056": "Act Ⅳ – A Speck of Crimson\n\n\"That was only an acci—\"\nThe Lady's death might indeed have been an accident. But even a swan knows: without Grand Duke Yushino's command, no gaoler would dare fetch the tools of torture.\nAnd of all people, the limping figure now standing before him knew Yushino best — and hated him most.\n\nSo before he could finish the sentence, she drove her sword straight through his skull.\n\nThe tip of the blade first reached his tongue — a soft, writhing strip of flesh that split in two, bright red. It reminded her of a serpent's tongue. The Lady had once said she feared nothing more than the eight-headed serpent from Yashnia's ancient myths.\nThen came something firmer — the upper palate. Heavy drinkers often complained of a burning sensation there. Yushino had drunk often, and well. Maybe his was tougher than most. Or maybe not — the steel passed through without resistance.\nAfter that, everything was easy: the hindbrain. Some say it governs sleep. Years ago, Yushino scoured the land for physicians to cure his insomnia. One had told him the problem lay in his hindbrain. She no longer remembered whether that poor man had ended up with his skull smashed or his tongue cut out. Now, Yushino had suffered both. A shattered skull and a severed tongue — quite a poetic ending for him, right?\nBefore his bloodied lips could kiss the edge of her blade, she pulled it free.\nA spray of scarlet spattered a folding screen; the fabric drank it in, the stain blooming like red leaves.\n\nShe remembered the day the Lady told her she no longer needed to call herself a swan.\n\nIt was an autumn afternoon, just before the frost set in. A northern wind from Hyperborea had swept away the last warmth lingering over Yashnia — only to spend all its strength in doing so. The sea turned bitter‑cold overnight. No nobles dared swim; no fishermen dared cast their nets.\nFurther inland, the farmers had just finished harvesting the wheat, yet still fretted that rain might come too soon and spoil the drying grain. Children, sent out reluctantly at the adults' urging, were tasked with picking up the fallen stalks — only to end up bickering over trifles halfway through. From the houses by the fields came the warm scent of fresh bread, baked with the season's first wheat. Cooking smoke curled gently from the chimneys.\nThrough that smoke flew the migratory birds bound south — save one small bird, a ribbon tied to its leg, winging the opposite way. It slipped through the domes and rooftops to deliver the four hundredth secret letter to Grand Duke Yushino.\nIt was his first year on the throne. Amidst sleepless nights, he had only just begun his long campaign — to purge his enemies and secure his rule. Perhaps the gods who govern the seasons took pity on his resolve and granted Yashnia another golden harvest.\nAnd in that hush of ripened wheat, not far from the palace, in a quiet courtyard — a swan said no.\n\nA cold wind stirred. The trees in the Lady's courtyard groaned softly, as if in pain. Red leaves drifted down like blood. One struck the Lady's face. She flinched with a startled yelp — like a cat caught by sudden darkness. The limping one reached out and gently brushed the leaf away.\nThe Lady's cheeks were flushed from the cold. She looked at her and said: \"From now on, you don't have to call yourself a swan. Your name... will be Redleaf. Only I will know this. Only I may call you this.\"\n\nThe swan hesitated. She agreed to stop calling herself a bird — but cautiously declined the name Redleaf, afraid that if she heard it too often,\nshe might come to love it. And along with it... too many other things.\n\nShe could no longer recall what happened next. Only that, somehow, she had cried — though she never knew quite why.\nTears are warm at first. But they soon turn cold. And so do the red leaves — fiery in hue, cold in the hand.\n\nCold, like Yushino's blood already congealing on marble.\n\nPerhaps it was because she hadn't danced in so long. She might have avoided the spatter, yet one drop landed on the hilt of her sword.\nShe tried to wipe the red away — again and again. But it wouldn't come off. And that brought her back to the moment when a red leaf had fallen onto the Lady's face. She had tried to brush it away, too — but hadn't been able to. As if she were waiting for someone else to do it for her.\nShe lingered again in that autumn, seven years ago — where everything had seemed well.\nSo be it, then. Let that speck of crimson remain.\nShe made no further attempt to wipe the blood away. Nor did she shy from the name Redleaf any longer. She turned and walked away — unchallenged, and alone.\n\nThus closed the tale of Redleaf: A Chronicle of Rebellion.\n\n\nParsifal's Note:\nThe protagonist's name — Redleaf — isn't revealed until the very final act. When the play first debuted, this twist had tremendous impact. But now, after so many stagings, most audiences know it going in. It's a shame — there's nothing quite like the first time.\nHere's an excerpt from the historical record. Might be useful...\n\"According to official chronicles, the third Grand Duke of Yashnia, Yushino, reigned for ten years. In the early years, he purged his political enemies and swept away many of the entrenched ills left by his predecessor, the second Grand Duke. But toward the end of his rule, he grew increasingly suspicious of his own kin. Eventually, he ordered the imprisonment and torture of his sister, resulting in her death. The very next day, he himself was found dead. By then, the fall of Yashnia — to either the Empire or the Elysian Church — had already become inevitable. That the Church ultimately took it... well, that's a matter for another chapter on court conspiracies.\nAs for Yushino's death, three theories persist: suicide brought on by madness, sudden death from chronic alcoholism, and assassination by a swordswoman named Redleaf. The third is deemed the least credible — and yet, it remains the version most widely believed. This account is also said to have inspired the now-famous play Redleaf: A Chronicle of Rebellion.",

  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010101": "For as long as you can remember, Berenica has always been by your side. \nYou may have spent more time with her than with anyone else in the world, yet there are still parts of her that remain a mystery to you — just as there are aspects of yourself that you don't fully understand.\nWho are you? Who is she? Where did you come from, and how did you meet? Whenever you pose these questions, Berenica hesitates, her words faltering, eventually retreating into prolonged silence. Over time, you stopped asking.\nThere's much you don't know, but of one thing you're certain—\nYou can always trust her, no matter what.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010102": "Berenica is unflinchingly straightforward and sincere. Unlike most, she never lies and often struggles with the subtleties of unspoken words. In a harsh world where people often disguise their true intentions with deceit and pleasantries, Berenica's candid remarks cut through these facades, always resulting in uncomfortable silences. As a child, her blunt honesty was often dismissed as mere youthful innocence. However, as she grew older, this trait increasingly alienated her from others in the village.\nConsequently, from a young age, you mastered the art of reading people and skillfully adapting your words to deal with different individuals. For the things she disliked or struggled with, you stepped in. You decided that you would be her mask and her voice.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010103": "In stark contrast to her meticulous protection of you, Berenica is ruthlessly hard on herself. Whenever she's attacked by wild beasts or Filthoids, she fights back with a self-destructive fervour, sparing no part of herself from exposure to danger as she charges forward with resolute determination. The outcome is invariably the same: her dark blade strikes true, killing the creature with a single blow. Naturally, the cost is often severe injuries to herself.\nEach time this happens, as you bandage her wounds, you plead with her not to be so reckless. Yet, she stubbornly insists it's the most efficient way she knows how to fight. \"It's fine — I don't mind the pain,\" she always says.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010104": "Many people, even in their twilight years, love to reminisce about their earliest days, which they fondly refer to as their \"childhood.\"\nFor them, childhood is synonymous with joy — a mere mention of those times brings forth smiles and eyes crinkling with happiness. Similarly, thinking back to your days with Berenica on Purgatorio Island naturally brings a smile to your face.\nHowever, if someone consistently avoids discussing their childhood, it likely suggests a past marred by hidden traumas and deep scars.\nThis realisation dawned on you one day. Since then, you've refrained from probing into Berenica's past before your shared memories. You made a promise: if she chooses not to speak of it, you won't push; but if she ever wishes to share, you'll be there for her.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010105": "Ever since arriving in the Empire, you've exhausted every possible means — both legitimate and otherwise — to find any trace of Berenica, but to no avail. Occasionally, from The Asphodel, you'd receive commissions that involved anonymous tips directing you to liberate a mysterious individual from an Imperial prison. Each time, you harboured a quiet hope of hearing that familiar voice from behind one of the cell doors you breached... Yet it never happened. Not even once.\nNevertheless, whenever you wield that pristine white sword, it feels as though she's still by your side. You hold onto the belief that you will reunite one day — for you will never break your promise, and neither will Berenica.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010201": "People often nurture idyllic fantasies about isolated places, yet not all secluded spots are sanctuaries of peace. Purgatorio Island, adrift in the desolate sea, is far from a paradise. On this beautiful little island, the malice that festers in hardship and isolation is all too familiar. The strong prey on the weak, and the weak, in turn, target those even weaker — it's a natural law that the villagers of Purgatorio Island know well and follow to the letter.\nHowever, this brutal \"law of survival\" met an unexpected challenge in the form of a little girl named Berenica.\nDespite being an orphan with no one to rely on, the hardships of life had not instilled in Berenica any idea of compromise or inclination to yield. Once she set her mind on something, neither brute intimidation nor sweet coaxing could make her budge. Even the island's brawniest fishermen couldn't overpower her — partly because her strength was shockingly immense for a child, but more so because she would fight with a ferocity that belied her size, like the cub of a savage beast baring its baby fangs. Nevertheless, there weren't many things that would push her buttons — she wasn't greedy for food or fortune. The only things she would desperately fight for were those concerning another child named {nickname}.\nBut that was a long time ago. By the time Berenica had grown to half the height of a grown man, not even all the adults on Purgatorio Island combined could stand against her. The way they looked at her had changed — their stares now held a hint of fear. \"She's probably a monster,\" they thought.\nBut aren't monsters supposed to be inherently selfish? Would a monster cherish another soul as deeply as she does?",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010202": "It was a midsummer morning, an otherwise unremarkable day on Purgatorio Island. The fishermen rose early, collecting freshly mended nets and sails from their wives before heading to the small pier where their boats awaited. They were set to face the briny breeze at sea for days, hoping to return laden with fish to sustain their families in the coming weeks.\nAmid the hustle of farewells at the dock, no one noticed a young girl, Abigail, sneaking away in the opposite direction, up the muddy mountain path. As she ran, the clamour of the village receded, and the wind whistling through charred branches filled the air with mournful sounds. Abigail reassured herself it wasn't the Filthoids, pressing a hand to her chest to steady her racing heart before keeping on.\nFor the villagers, the mountains were not a place to visit these days. Just two days ago, they had heard a deafening roar from the abandoned temple in the mountains, followed by a fire that was fortunately doused by a sudden downpour. Some claimed it was the goddess punishing them for their irreverence; others whispered it was the work of the woman who lived in the mountains, or that the Filthoids had been roused. Despite the varied theories, everyone agreed on one thing: stay away from the mountain, at least for now.\nBut Abigail had no choice. Her mother's gout had worsened, and Abigail had heard her mother's pained groans echoing through the night. She knew of a medicinal herb near the temple that might offer relief. Despite the risks, she resolved to make the journey.\nPreoccupied with her destination, she failed to notice what lay hidden in the undergrowth and was brought down by something soft underfoot. Rubbing her bruised knee, she glanced at the thicket, and the sight made her gasp and stumble back in terror.\n\"A d—dead body...!!!\"\nIt was a child, about five or six years old, with delicate features that suggested she was a girl. The little girl was covered in soot and grime, her once beautiful silver hair matted with mud. Curled up tightly like a newborn, she lay surrounded by the lifeless bodies of several Filthoids, along with a blackened knife.\nHad she been attacked by the Filthoids? But if so, who killed those beasts?\n\"You...\" Overcoming her initial shock, Abigail's concern took over. She clutched her pounding chest and hesitantly prodded the little girl's shoulder. \"Hey, are you... alive?\"\nWhether it was because Abigail had just accidentally stepped on her or because Abigail's voice woke her, the \"corpse\" suddenly shuddered, followed by intense trembling. She's alive! Relief washed over Abigail. \"Thank goodness! Lemme help you get up!\"\nTrying to grasp the little girl's hand, Abigail found her arms tightly crossed over something clutched to her chest. No matter how hard Abigail tugged, the girl wouldn't let go. \"You have to give me your hand,\" Abigail sighed, circling around to face the child. \"It's okay, I'm here to help you.\"\nThe little girl struggled to open her eyes, warily watching Abigail, her gaze meeting Abigail's sincere, kind eyes. She bit her chapped lips, as if wrestling with a tough decision. Finally, with a heavy nod, she seemed to make up her mind, reluctantly loosening her arms.\nAs dawn's light filtered through the trees, Abigail finally saw what the girl had been guarding so desperately — it was another, even younger, child.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010203": "On the first evening, the two children lay huddled in the grass, their faint, laboured breaths were the only sign of life. Abigail had seen similar scenes during childhood hunting trips with her father, where she encountered orphaned young animals helplessly huddled in thickets without their mothers.\nAbigail placed a jug of fresh water beside the older girl, alongside some dried fish and stale bread arranged on a scrap of cloth — it was the best she could do. When she had pleaded with the villagers to help save the children, she was met with stark indifference. While the kinder villagers explained that the community was too poor to take on the burden of two more mouths to feed, those less kind chastised her for even venturing up the mountain. Some recognised the horns on the children's heads — a feature unwelcome back in their homeland of Hyperborea. Even her usually compassionate mother frowned, saying their own family was barely getting by and couldn't afford additional burdens.\n\"I hope you'll both be safe,\" Abigail murmured, setting down the food and casting one last worried glance back before walking away.\n\nBy the second night, the older girl had regained some strength. She managed to get up, lifting the younger child and staggering towards a small cave nearby for shelter from the nighttime rain. Although devoid of food, the cave offered them a dry place to rest. After settling the younger child inside, she collapsed to the ground, utterly drained. Following a brief rest, she stumbled back to where Abigail had left the provisions. She opened the jug and drank deeply before realising something; she then quickly capped it and stumbled back towards the cave — knowing how precious this jug of fresh water was, she saved most of it for the younger child.\n\nOn the third morning, when Abigail once again sneaked up the mountain, she found the girl sitting by the cave wall, bandaging her wounds with that scrap of cloth she had left behind. Despite being covered in injuries, the girl appeared somewhat revitalized, a faint sparkle returning to her crimson eyes. Abigail noticed the girl's lips moving, as if she wanted to say something, but instead, she remained silent, staring intently at the empty jug.\nRealising the girl must be thirsty, Abigail picked up the jug, intending to refill it at the stream. Suddenly, the girl grabbed her arm, shaking her head firmly. \"I... go with you,\" she rasped, her voice raw from disuse.\nAbigail helped the girl to the stream, watching as she struggled to lean down and fill the jug. The girl seemed reluctant to rely on anyone's help, trying to do everything herself despite her injuries. Abigail felt a twinge of sympathy. Although the village children were taught to share their parents' burdens from a young age, it pained her to see a child so young bearing such severe wounds and striving to do everything alone.\n\nOn the fourth afternoon, a group of fishermen returned home. They had a bountiful catch this time, which sold for a good price at the empire's port, allowing them to bring back cloth and food from the mainland. This was usually the happiest day for the village children, but Abigail's mind was still on the girls in the mountains. She carefully wrapped her share of the pastries and tucked it into her basket.\nReaching the mountain, Abigail saw that the girl had cleaned her face in the stream. With the grime gone, Abigail realised that she was quite a beautiful child.\n\"Th-Thank... you,\" the girl's voice was less hoarse than the day before. It seemed she hadn't spoken in a long time, carefully enunciating each syllable. \"Thank you.\" She solemnly took the basket from Abigail. \"With this... {性别：he|she} will get better soon.\"\nCurious, Abigail couldn't help but ask, \"Where do you two come from? I've never seen you before. Oh, and...\" She hesitated, curiosity getting the better of her, \"I've heard there was a woman living on the mountain. Is she your mother? What happened to her? Do you know anything about the loud noise a few days ago?\"\nAt the mention of the woman on the mountain, the girl's body visibly tensed. \"Can't... can't talk about it,\" she muttered, biting her lower lip.\n\"Alright, forget it.\" Abigail waved it off, feeling a bit deflated. \"The village's more crowded these days, I might not be able to sneak up here very often. You two take care of yourselves, alright?\"\n\nOn the evening of the tenth day, Abigail encountered the two children by the sea.\nThey appeared to have fully recovered. The two small figures stood on the beach where the tide had receded, the setting sun casting a golden glow on their beautiful silver hair and the vast expanse of white sand.\nUpon seeing Abigail, the older child took the younger one's hand and slowly walked over, carrying the basket Abigail had left behind, now filled with small fish, shrimp, and crabs. \"This is for you,\" she said. \"As a thank-you.\"\nAbigail was about to decline the offer with a wave of her hand, but the determination in the girl's eyes made her reconsider. Accepting the basket, she noticed the girl's faint smile.\nAbigail smiled back, feeling reassured that they were now capable of surviving on their own.\n\nYears later, during an interview with The Tides Daily, Abigail Morley, now a successful fishing tycoon, reflected on some deep memories upon the reporter's question: \"Ms Morley, I have one last question. I've heard you built your fortune from scratch. What changed your life? Or rather, what are the three most significant events that shaped it?\"\n\"The first event was when my home island was ravaged by Filthoids. My parents and I managed to escape, but they were already in poor health and sustained injuries along the way. They passed away soon after, leaving me to fend for myself. As for the second event... it might have had more significance to the world than to me.\"\nAbigail paused, her thoughts drifting back to that seemingly ordinary morning many years ago. While the villagers were busy seeing off the fishermen, young Abigail ventured alone into the mountains to gather herbs for her ailing mother.\n\"That day, I saved two children younger than myself on the mountain,\" she continued. \"At the time, I didn't realise I was setting the wheels of history in motion.\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010204": "During her time in the Legion, Berenica was often referred to as the \"Empire's New Blade.\" The expressions accompanying this title varied — sometimes it was admiration, other times fear, and occasionally, a hint of mockery. Clearly, those were not the looks one would direct towards an ordinary human being. Consequently, Berenica grew to utterly despise the title.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010205": "\"She smiles more often now, almost like an ordinary child. And she's much stronger and braver than I ever imagined... Knowing this, I can entrust {nickname} to her care. With each passing day, I grew more certain that taking her away from the Legion was the right decision. Now, it's time for me to pay the price for that decision... I'm sorry, Berenica. Please forgive me for having to leave.\"\n\"And... I love you. Both of you.\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010301": "Berenica has a soft spot for anything fluffy and cuddly, like the silky fur of small animals.\nUnfortunately, the feeling isn't mutual. Whenever they lock eyes with her, even the gentlest cats suddenly arch their backs and bolt away like startled, furry projectiles.\nThis leaves Berenica frustrated, with no choice but to wrap an arm around your head and playfully ruffle your soft hair until it's a tousled mess.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010302": "Berenica's sleep has always been shallow, a consequence of old, ingrained habits. Yet, occasionally, she's haunted by unsettling dreams — sometimes she finds herself back in past confinements, sometimes lost in a desolate forest, or adrift alone on an endless sea. More often, she finds herself trapped in a vast glass chamber, where ominous waters rise from every direction, engulfing her limbs, her chest, her ears, and her eyes, submerging her every sense in a suffocating dread.\nThese dreams often jolt her awake in a cold sweat, overwhelmed by stark fear and solitude. Her panic only subsides when she detects the steady rhythm of your breathing beside her, a gentle reminder that she is not alone.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010303": "Berenica never cries. Regardless of the intensity of her pain or the depth of her despair, she merely clenches her teeth and endures without shedding a single tear. For a child, crying serves as an expression of discomfort and a plea for solace. However, for a weapon, tears are a sign of weakness, merely moisture that would rust the steel. Long before she found a family who truly cared for her, Berenica had already lost the ability to cry.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010304": "Berenica has always been vaguely aware of the extraordinary powers within her. In tales told by minstrels and bards, characters endowed with significant strength usually bear grand destinies — like saving the world or ascending to a throne. But Berenica harbours no interest in such fates. Should she ever come to harness her powers fully, she intends to use them solely to safeguard her loved ones. While others might consider it a waste, for Berenica, protecting her family is what matters most.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010305": "Berenica has always seen protecting you as her paramount mission, viewing you as a younger, less robust child who could not possibly manage without her. Yet, that day on the cliff, when she saw you make that signal for the first time, she suddenly realised it was she who could not live without you.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010401": "The villagers of Purgatorio Island often set up fishing nets along the beach, taking advantage of the tides to catch fish. After they'd hauled in everything visible, some smaller fish and shrimp were left behind — these scraps became the primary source of food for Berenica and {nickname} before they were old enough to work. Wading through the sands left behind by other fishermen's hauls, the two children scoured the murky waters for any remaining small fish and shrimp. This task was not only tedious and exhausting but also yielded little. However, they managed to make it fun by turning it into a competition to see who could gather more \"treasures.\"\n\"Look, Berry! I caught a big one!\" {nickname} exclaimed from a short distance, proudly holding up a fish about the size of a hand. The fishermen would never bother to bend over for fish of this size, but to them, it was a bountiful prize.\n\"That's impressive,\" Berenica smiled in response.\nPleased with the acknowledgement, {nickname} didn't immediately put the fish into the basket. Instead, {性别：he|she} held it proudly for a moment, savouring the victory — until the fish's sharp fin pricked {性别：his|her} palm, leaving a \"battle wound.\" When it came time to tally their finds, it was clear that Berenica had come out on top. Unwilling to admit defeat, {nickname} protested, \"If I hadn't gotten hurt, I definitely would've won! It's all that fish's fault... Let's stew it tonight.\"\n\"Don't be a sore loser. Remember to be more careful next time,\" Berenica said, only to realise {nickname} had already slung the basket over {性别：his|her} shoulder and taken off towards home.\n\"Race you home!\" {性别：he|she} shouted from a distance, waving at Berenica.\nWith a resigned smile, Berenica adjusted her own basket and took off to join in this unfair race. No sooner had she started than the weather took a sudden turn, raining down heavily and drenching them completely. \"Just my luck,\" Berenica thought glumly, but before she could dwell on it, {nickname}'s lively voice floated back through the downpour, \"Look, Berry, it's raining!\" {性别：he|she} reached out to catch the raindrops, chuckling. \"Now we don't have to go up the mountain for water. This must be a gift from the gods... We're so lucky! Luckier than those princes and princesses in the palace!\"\nBerenica couldn't help but smile. She didn't believe in gods. To her, rain was just another natural occurrence. But on that last point, she could agree — the time spent with {nickname} was indeed priceless.\n\"Tomorrow, I should let {性别：him|her} win.\" Berenica thought, quickening her pace to catch up.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010402": "To add variety to their meals, Berenica and {nickname} would sometimes venture into the mountains to forage for fruits and vegetables. The mountain terrain was treacherous, teeming with wild beasts. To avoid startling these creatures, especially in emergencies, Berenica came up with a system of silent signals: two taps on the right shoulder meant \"watch your back,\" and two taps over the heart signified \"come closer.\"\n\"Let's add one more — a nose boop to signal 'all clear.'\" Berenica suggested to {nickname}. \"These should be enough for now. Make sure you remember them.\"\nThanks to these signals, the two children managed to navigate many dangerous situations until the day they encountered a greater threat — Filthoids. It was {nickname}'s first encounter with such creatures, but Berenica knew just how deadly they were. She instantly sprang into action, shielding {nickname} behind her as she grappled with the fearsome monsters, sustaining several wounds in the process. Though she eventually subdued the beasts, she soon realised that their attacks had poisoned her.\nIn her last moments before losing consciousness, Berenica caught a glimpse of {nickname}'s panicked face. She attempted to speak, but her strength failed her.\nWhen Berenica finally regained consciousness, she found herself safely in her own bed at home.\n\"Berry...? Berry! You're awake!\" {nickname} cried out, rushing to her side and gripping her hand tightly, as if afraid she might vanish in an instant.\n\"Don't worry, I'm alright now,\" Berenica reassured {性别：him|her} as she propped herself up and surveyed the room. To her surprise, the place was in complete disarray — pots and bowls were scattered around the stove, some filled with dubious-looking liquids. Their piggy bank had been turned upside down, emptied of every last coin. {nickname} had always been a steady, balanced child — perhaps a bit too steady for {性别：his|her} age — and {性别：he|she} would never cause such chaos even when alone at home. Puzzled, Berenica probed further and learned that {nickname} had spent all the money on medicine.\n\"I panicked and just paid whatever the shopkeeper asked for the medicine. When I found the coins in the piggy bank weren't enough to cover the cost, he offered me a discount... But after I got home and tried mixing the ingredients myself, I realised they were just ground vegetables, not a real cure,\" {nickname} murmured. \"I'm sorry, Berry. I know you've been saving those coins for a long time...\"\nThe silver-haired child stood there, head hung low, hands wringing, sweat beading on {性别：his|her} nose. Berenica noticed {性别：his|her} dishevelled hair and dirty clothes, realising {性别：he|she} probably had neither rested nor eaten properly while she was unconscious. As if on cue, {nickname}'s stomach growled loudly.\n\"...Honestly,\" Berenica sighed with a mix of amusement and frustration as she tidied {nickname}'s hair. \"Looks like we need one more signal. Mmm... in a real emergency, we might not have time for gestures... Let's go with three blinks. Three blinks, that's our new signal.\"\n\"Huh? What does that mean?\"\n\"It means even if I'm no longer with you, you need to take care of yourself and live on,\" Berenica replied.\n\"No! I don't want that!\" {nickname} shook {性别：his|her} head vigorously, like a silver rattle drum. \"We're family, aren't we? Family always sticks together.\"\nA distant, hazy figure from Berenica's past flickered in her mind. Even family could suddenly leave each other — she had experienced that firsthand.\n\"{nickname}, listen to me... This signal isn't about separation. It's about what you need to do if we're ever forced apart... You need to take care of yourself and live on, so that we can find each other again.\" Berenica looked straight into {nickname}'s eyes, her tone more serious than ever. \"So, remember this signal — three blinks mean 'Even if left all alone, you should be brave and live on... until the day we meet again.'\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010403": "\"Get up and keep fighting.\"\nThe cold, detached voice cut through the air from behind the glass partition as another batch of combat drones was released into the cramped training arena. Their menacing red lights flickered as they surged towards the young girl at the centre.\nClutching her sword, the girl struggled to rise from the remnants of her previous foes. Despite the searing pain that racked her body and the near exhaustion of her arms, she swiftly adjusted her stance. Hoisting the red blade taller than herself, she mechanically repeated her slashing motions. The adults in dark grey uniforms had taught her that failure to do so meant she would be the one shattered on the floor.\nToday's opponents were tougher, and the training session lasted longer than ever before. Such a gruelling test was far beyond what any child should endure, yet the girl had no concept of normalcy. She was unaware that beyond the one-way glass, those adults were observing her with feverish excitement, while the only feedback she ever received was a repetitive \"not enough.\" Since birth, she had been indoctrinated with a single purpose: to become the sharpest of swords. Thus, she unquestioningly accepted each brutal training session, enduring the pain and viewing each harsher challenge as an affirmation of her worth.\n\"That's enough for today. Good job, No. 0.\"\nThe day's training ended with a light, almost dismissive praise. Drained, the girl dragged herself back to her room, too weary even to eat. She collapsed into bed, but was tormented by her wounds to the point of sleeplessness. She lay counting the minutes, hoping for the pain to subside more quickly.\n\"Child... child?\"\nA voice whispered at midnight as the girl continued counting the minutes. It was so gentle, like the moonlight slipping into her room through the narrow window. \"I must be dreaming,\" she thought, for in this steel prison, no one ever spoke to her like this. But the voice came again, closer this time, as if right beside her bed. In the darkness, she couldn't see the speaker. She sat up in her cold bed, whispering, \"Are you...talking to me?\"\nHer voice trembled. The visitor seemed nervous too. \"Yes. Don't be afraid, child... here, have some fruit!\"\nThat figure offered softly, handing over a small, deep-red fruit in their palm. Much later, Berenica would learn its name — pomegranate.\n\"My name is 'No. 0,'\" the girl murmured, nervously fiddling with the fruit in her hands.\n\"That's not a good name.\" the figure replied, reaching out a hand towards her. \"Come on, let's leave this place. I'll give you a better name.\"\n\"Leave... Where to?\" The little girl's voice, usually cold and devoid of emotion, now held a rare note of innocent confusion.\n\"To a place without war or pain.\"\nThat would be impossible. War and pain were ubiquitous and inescapable, for her fate had already been decided, as she had been indoctrinally taught to accept. She realised this person was tempting her to do something against the rules, something that defied her destiny, something she should reject outright and report to the adults in dark grey uniforms. Yet the moonlight, now piercing through the window, illuminated the visitor's sincere, pure eyes, igniting in the girl a profound yearning to escape to a place where she might touch the moon herself.\nNodding, she grasped the extended hand and whispered, \"Okay.\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010404": "\"Berenica, my dear, listen closely,\" the woman bent down, hugging Berenica tightly before pushing her away. Her voice, typically gentle, was now laced with anxiety and unease. \"Quickly, take {nickname} down to the village at the foot of the mountain.\" She paused, rifling through a drawer to retrieve several pieces of fine jewellery and a pocket watch. \"Take these with you. The villagers might take you in. Just tell them you're orphans who drifted ashore and know nothing about the outside world, and that these were your mother's belongings.\"\n\"Aren't you coming with us?\" Berenica asked.\n\"I can't.\"\nBerenica froze, her mind going blank. She blinked in disbelief. \"You're... leaving us?\"\n\"You'll never have a peaceful life with me around. Just go, protect {nickname}, and live your own lives. Forget about the Hyperborean Empire, the 13th Legion, and No. 0. Remember, you're just an ordinary child. You're Berenica. Just Berenica.\"\nShe reeled off her instructions rapidly, then tenderly stroked Berenica's hair once more. There was a fleeting hesitation, a reluctance to part, that Berenica felt deeply in her touch. But the woman quickly withdrew her hand as if it burned, turned away, and steeled her voice. \"No time to lose. Remember your sprint training? You have ten minutes. Leave the temple and reach the village road in ten minutes. This is an order.\"\nThe woman's authoritative tone revived Berenica's earliest memories — follow every order without question. That had been drilled into her since she could remember. She instinctively responded, \"Yes, ma'am.\" But then she paused, shaking her head and looking desperately at the woman as if begging her to rescind the order. \"Why...? I don't understand—\"\n\"Berenica, forget about me and everything in the past. Never come back here.\"\nBerenica instinctively stepped back as the temple door thundered shut before her. She didn't even see when the woman pressed the button to trigger the mechanism. {nickname}, startled by the sudden noise, clung to her arm in fear.\nWith one last lingering look at the closed door, Berenica scooped up {nickname} and set off without turning back.\n\"I have ten minutes,\" she echoed the command, \"protect {nickname}, and live on...\" She muttered under her breath, \"I can do this.\"\nTen minutes later, as Berenica walked the mountain path, a deafening explosion rolled up from behind. She didn't know exactly what had transpired, but she had a pretty good idea. She blinked, but her eyes remained dry — tears had long been strangers to her. Yet, something within her seemed to spill over, like the debris tumbling down the mountain behind her.\nThat night saw both mountain fire and deluge, and to Berenica, the rain from that night never ceased.\nAfterwards, Berenica and {nickname} narrowly escaped death by the Filthoids and were rescued by a kind-hearted girl from the village. Despite everything, they managed to survive.\nLater on, Berenica returned to the temple's entrance several times, though she never dared to break her promise by turning the \"key.\" Instead, she stood silently outside, waiting. She hoped that one day the door would suddenly open, and the woman would step out, tenderly smiling, and bend down to pat her head and say, \"Everything's okay now. I'm back.\"\nSeasons changed, but the door remained shut, and waiting became a habit. It was not until a dried pomegranate fell and struck Berenica on the head one day that she abruptly snapped back to reality. She picked up the pomegranate and remembered how, every year when the fruit ripened, that woman would pick some to bring home, wash them clean, and give them to her and {nickname} to eat.\nClutching the shrivelled, already inedible fruit, Berenica finally realised the woman would never return. From then on, it would be just her and {nickname}.\n\"I will keep my promise,\" she vowed silently. \"I will take good care of {性别：him|her}, and I won't let you down.\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11010405": "Perhaps it was a stroke of luck that Berenica's rigorous childhood training made adapting to a nomadic life almost effortless. In the early days after escaping the Legion, she followed the woman who had rescued her, enduring nights in damp, dark caves, braving tempests on churning seas, and evading Imperial pursuers along precipitous cliffs. No matter how harsh or dangerous the circumstances, she never once complained or paused for rest.\nYet, more difficult than enduring pain was the challenge of forgetting it.\nEven after escaping that prison and successfully evading endless pursuit, the shadows of her past lingered. Even after settling down on Purgatorio Island, remnants of her old life persistently haunted her: she would wake up before dawn, sitting blankly for long moments before realising there was no longer a need for early morning training. Despite food being within easy reach, she would wait until the designated mealtime to eat. When sick or injured, she bore the discomfort silently, never seeking help. If she accidentally came into physical contact with anyone, she instinctively recoiled, sometimes even taking a battle stance. Occasionally, even a bird flying past the window could jolt her into alertness.\nThen she met you — small, soft, exuding innocence from within the embrace of that woman, your smile untainted by the world. Tentatively, she touched your cheek, and you clutched her finger with your tiny hand. You seemed so delicate, as if the slightest danger could easily snuff out your life.\nFor the first time, Berenica felt a deep urge to protect someone. To set a good example for you, she disciplined herself to adopt regular sleeping and waking routines. To ensure your healthy growth, she experimented with various foods, clumsily collecting all sorts of ingredients that people said were delicious. To care for your health, she learned to recognise the signs of illness — like how catching a cold would bring coughs, and heatstroke would cause dizziness. To avoid frightening you, she trained herself to suppress her instinctual defensive reactions and began to smile more often. As she watched you grow, she gradually rediscovered herself, reclaiming the human experiences and feelings she thought she had long lost.\nOne ordinary afternoon, after cleaning the house, Berenica leaned back in her chair and inadvertently dozed off. In her half-sleep, she felt a familiar touch on her face. When she opened her eyes, there you were, having clambered onto the table, gently poking her cheek with your little fingers. This was perhaps the first time she had ever allowed someone to be in a position to potentially harm her. Berenica smiled and gently pinched your cheek in return. At that moment, she felt an undeniable sense of truly being alive in this world.\nIf anyone were to ask Berenica why you mean so much to her, the answer would likely be simple — it was your presence that finally allowed her to transform from the Empire's weapon, \"No. 0,\" into the girl named \"Berenica.\"",

  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11030201": "On a quiet street in the southern outer city of Icelake, a woman who ran a small bakery was still waiting for one of her regulars to return.\n\nMore than a decade ago, she had no storefront — just a humble stall set up on that same street. Every morning, as she prepared to open for the day, she would hear the silvery, ringing voice of a child singing from one of the upstairs windows. Though she never saw the one who sang, she came to think of that child as an unseen companion — someone who, like her, was greeting the morning with effort and hope. Whenever she grew weary or close to giving up, just hearing that voice was enough to keep her going.\n\nOne day, the woman noticed that the song from upstairs sounded different. Though no musician herself, even she could hear the change — the notes felt distracted, uneven, as if something weighed heavily on the child's heart. It continued for several days. Then one morning, just as the child's song trailed off mid-note, a sharp cry followed. Startled, the woman rushed upstairs — only to run into a flustered Charon boy.\n\n\"Ma'am, my mother — she's fainted! Please, we need help... please!\" the boy stammered, barely able to form his words.\n\nShe froze for a beat. That voice — she recognised it immediately. There was no doubt: this boy was the singer, the unseen companion whose voice had greeted her morning after morning.\n\nGathering herself quickly, she helped the boy bring his mother to a nearby clinic. With treatment, the woman's condition stabilised, though the boy refused to leave her bedside. Seeing he hadn't eaten all day, the baker returned to her stall, filled a basket with bread, and brought it to the clinic.\n\n\"Thank you... thank you so much, ma'am,\" the boy said again and again. \"I—I don't even know how to repay you.\"\n\"Just call me Auntie Horrel,\" the woman replied with a smile. \"And no need to thank me — you've helped me plenty, too.\"\nThe boy blinked in confusion.\n\"Thanks to you,\" she said, \"I've had free opera performances every morning. I've been meaning to tell you — child, you sing beautifully.\"\n\"Th—Thank you, Auntie Horrel!\" the boy stammered, surprise flashing across his face, along with a trace of shyness. \"But... my mother always said we shouldn't accept kindness without giving something in return.\"\n\"Then next time,\" the woman chuckled, \"just come buy a piece of bread at my stall.\"\n\nIt had been an offhand remark, something she'd said without thinking. Yet from that day onward, the boy really did start coming down every few days to buy a piece of bread. Through small exchanges, Auntie Horrel gradually learned more about him. He had never known his father. For as long as he could remember, it had always been just him and his mother. She had been frail for years, but recently, her health had begun to decline more rapidly.\n\nAuntie Horrel prayed quietly for the boy and his mother. Yet the boy's singing never returned to what it once was. No matter the tune, a thread of sorrow was always woven through it. Listening to his voice, she often found herself overcome with quiet sadness. There was little she could do to help, so she did what she could — each day, setting aside the softest, fullest loaf she had, saving it just for him, hoping that its simple warmth and sweetness might ease, even if only a little, the sorrow he carried.\n\nThen, one day, the singing stopped. And the boy no longer came to buy bread.\n\nMany days passed, until Auntie Horrel happened to catch sight of him again — walking down the street, hollow-eyed and lost in thought. She called out to him at once.\n\n\"Why don't you sing anymore?\" she asked gently.\n\"My mother passed away,\" he replied. His voice was dry, brittle. \"I used to sing to make her happy... but now that she's gone...\"\nAuntie Horrel fell silent for a moment. Then she placed a warm bag of bread into his hands.\n\"Your mother once told me,\" she said, \"that she hoped you'd grow up to sing on a real stage someday. A bright one, where everyone could hear your voice. Even if she's not here anymore... you can still make that wish come true.\"\nThe boy looked up, a faint light stirring in his eyes.\n\nIn truth, the woman had only met his mother a handful of times. She remembered only a reticent figure who always kept her face hidden beneath hats and veils. But none of that mattered now. The only thing she could offer the boy — was one small lie, told with kindness.\n\nThe next morning, his singing returned. Perhaps because it had been silent for so long, it now carried a deeper strength — and a greater tenderness — than ever before.\n\nYear after year, the snows of Icelake fell and melted again. The boy grew into a young man, and the woman's humble stall became a proper bakery. One ordinary morning, just before opening time, someone knocked at the shop door.\n\n\"Auntie Horrel, I'll be away for a while,\" the young man said, handing her a small pouch of coins and a house key. \"I've enlisted in the Legion. While I'm gone... could you look after my home?\"\n\"Of course. But I can't take your money,\" the woman said softly, pushing the pouch back toward him. \"You're living all on your own — you'll need it far more than I will. But why the Legion? Aren't you going to sing anymore?\"\n\"I want to earn my place as a Laurelled Charon. That's the only way I'll ever stand on a real stage,\" he explained, nudging the pouch back toward her. \"Please take it. I can't accept your help for nothing.\"\n\"Then repay me when you come back,\" she said, handing him the loaf she'd already set aside — the softest, as always. \"When you make it big, come and be the face of my bakery, alright?\"\n\"If you'd have me...\"\n\"Then it's a promise.\" She waved him off with a warm smile. \"May your dream come true, Parsifal.\"",

His former mentor once recalled: even in the quietest, most overlooked scenes, he gave his full, unwavering effort. Part of it was discipline, of course. Parsifal was nothing if not diligent.

As with all gatherings of its kind, the room pulsed with the worship of wealth and the hunger for status, gilded over with empty courtesies and polished flattery. And yet, amid all the glitter and pretence, a fairytale romance was quietly about to unfold.\n\nIt was his first time attending a banquet of such grandeur. He was dressed impeccably, his manner carefully composed — yet the unease in his eyes and the stiffness in his posture betrayed him. Young and sharp, he was a self-made businessman whose fortune in the steel trade had finally earned him a seat among the city's elite. Yet no tailoring could mask the humble roots he wore so plainly, and everyone in the hall — himself included — could see it. Eyes followed him with quiet amusement. Polite smiles met his greetings — just a shade too condescending — only to give way, behind his back, to snickers over his outdated taste and clumsy small talk. After being coaxed by a sharp-tongued noble into downing three glasses of biting spirits, he quietly slipped into a shadowed corner and murmured a request for a glass of plain water.\n\nShe was a darling of the inner city's social scene — no stranger to banquets like this. She navigated the endless stream of admirers with practised ease, making each one feel like the only one. With a few carefully chosen words, she even managed to calm two young gentlemen who had nearly come to blows over her. From the corner of her eye, she caught sight of a baron — the same one who had given her an extravagant necklace only a few days earlier. He was with another woman now: young, beautiful, someone she didn't recognise. It hardly surprised her. In the eyes of these nobles, she was no different from a fine porcelain vase — expensive, ornamental, replaceable. Crack it, stain it, grow bored of it, and there would always be another. But unlike a vase, she could do what no ornament ever could — speak, and smile. With grace, wit, and charm, she could always make herself sought after again. It was a game she played to perfection — and always won. Just as she gathered her skirts, poised to rejoin the game with all her polished art, a sudden wave of dizziness caught her off guard. Perhaps it was the wine she had just downed. She turned towards the refreshment table instead and caught sight of a plate of freshly sliced lemons. She picked one up — a small habit of hers. A sharp jolt of sourness always helped to clear her head.\n\nTo avoid staining her white gown, she popped the whole lemon wedge into her mouth. When she looked up, she found the man staring at her, water glass in hand, utterly bewildered.\n\"...Isn't that sour?\" he asked.\nShe could only nod, cheeks puffed full, and managed a muffled \"Mhm.\"\n\"Then why eat it?\"\nShe tapped her temple lightly, meaning to say: to wake herself up.\nThe man stared at her for a moment — it was hard to tell whether he understood or not. But then, he picked up a wedge himself, mimicked her exactly — and the instant he bit down, his features twisted into a full, miserable grimace.\nShe chuckled softly, covering her mouth with a handkerchief as she gracefully spat out the rind. Then, with practised composure, she asked, \"Feeling a bit more awake now, sir?\"\n\"Y—Yes... thank you, miss. You're... very beautiful,\" he stammered, nearly choking on his water. The words could easily have sounded like sarcasm — but to her, they were the most sincere thing she had heard all evening.\n\"My name is Herzeleide Snowfield,\" she said. \"I don't believe we've met. And you are?\"\n\"Morris Glenville. I'm a merchant.\"\n\"A merchant?\" she echoed, tilting her head slightly, her gaze curious but free of the slightest condescension. \"And what kind of trade are you in?\"\nHe smiled. \"A bit of everything. Though lately, I've been thinking of trying fruit imports — maybe something a little less sour than these.\"\nShe laughed. And so did he.\n\nAnd so, in a hall of blinding splendour, two kindred souls found each other — in a corner softened by shadow, where the gilded light could not quite reach. Like a lemon sinking into a glass of water, the bitterness softened — just enough to leave a hint of sweetness.\n\nFairytales are fairytales because they end just in time — while the illusion of \"happily ever after\" still holds, shielding the reader from the ugly truth that waits beyond the beauty.

  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11030204": "Years ago, the name Herzeleide was known across all of Icelake's high society. She was the muse of countless fantasies, the bellwether of fashion, the star of every ballroom. Some adored her — hopelessly smitten, longing to set her upon a pedestal and proclaim her the perfect woman. Others loathed her — sneering that she was nothing but a lowborn seductress who had clawed her way up by charming powerful men, eager to see her dragged back into the dirt.\n\nBut who was she, really?\n\nShe was born into an ordinary Charon household. Orphaned young, she took work as a maid in an inn to fend for herself. She was clever, meticulous, hard-working — until the night her beauty caught the wrong kind of attention from a nobleman staying at the inn.\n\nThe hearts of Icelake's folk were like the lake itself — cold to the core. No one pitied this lowborn Charon girl, even knowing full well she was the victim. She was cast out in disgrace, branded with shame, and left to scrape by in the slums.\n\nShe thought she would rot there, forgotten. But fate wasn't finished toying with her yet.\nYears later, the same nobleman returned — sickly, dying — and, perhaps seeking to soothe his conscience before the end, he showered her with gifts: wealth, a home in the inner city, even the hollow honour of a Laurelled Charon's title.\n\nTo the world, it looked as though she had struck gold overnight. To her, however, it was nothing but a sick joke. No apology, no fortune could ever mend the hollow torn open inside her. No one could imagine the life she had been forced to endure — the pain that clung to her like a second skin. She came to despise mirrors, and anything that dared reflect her face. She hated her beauty. She hated her own naivety. Because the world had taught her it was her fault: Why hadn't she been plainer? Why hadn't she known better?\n\nThen, everything turned on its head overnight. Her beauty — once a curse that had damned her — became a prize nobles worshipped. After a brief stunned hesitation, she steeled herself — and chose revenge. She would learn their games, speak their tongue, and wound them where it hurt most. She crafted herself a surname of elegance. She immersed herself in etiquette, literature, the arts, and current affairs. Before long, her beauty and sharpened mind made her the most coveted courtesan in all the inner city.\n\nShe drifted from gala to gala, relishing the quiet satisfaction of turning nobles into puppets of their own longing — pulling at their strings with effortless grace. Her heart, day by day, froze into something unrecognisable. She all but forgot the girl she had once been. Until the day she met him.\n\nHe wasn't a noble. He, too, wore a mask at every glittering gathering. And because of that, he saw through hers — glimpsed the loneliness buried beneath the dazzle. She believed it to be fate's final mercy — a chance to reclaim the self she had lost to the world. Beneath the hush of a tender night, she laid bare her heart. In his presence, even amid the glittering halls and their hollow splendour, her heart could beat warm and alive once more.\n\nMonths later, when she discovered she was carrying his child, her heart overflowed with joy. But the man grew hesitant. His business had already soared; wealth alone no longer satisfied him. What he craved now was standing — privilege, acceptance. And she, a Charon, could offer him none of it. She was like a fish flung from its tank, left gasping on cold floor. She pleaded. She reasoned. She said she had connections, that she could help grow his ventures. She cried. She humbled herself. At last, he relented — and made a single, conditional promise: If the child was born Solarian, he would make her his wife.\n\nOn an autumn night beneath the silver moon, her child was born. He was a beautiful boy — fair-skinned, delicate, lovely — and on his brow, a pair of small, black horns. They were beautiful horns, gleaming faintly at the tips — rare even among Charons. It was believed that children born with such horns were destined to awaken as Daimons.\n\nShe stared at those tiny horns, her heart sinking into despair. With trembling hands, she fumbled for a knife. If only the horns were gone. It was all their fault. If she were to cut them away... she could still have her happy ending.\n\nBut just as the blade caught the cold gleam of the moonlight, the baby opened his eyes — and looked at her. In those clear, bright eyes, she saw her own reflection.\n\nShe, too, bore horns. Horns just like his. Only then did she realise: after all these years, she had never truly stopped hating herself — or denying who she was.\n\nSlowly, she set the knife down.\nShe gathered the child into her arms and whispered:\n\"Come, my little one. Let's leave this place.\"\nThus ended the tale of Herzeleide — once a belle among the glittering halls of the inner city.",

  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11030401": "I was born in the outer city, into what you'd probably call an ordinary household — though in truth, it wasn't all that ordinary. I never knew my father. My mother raised me on her own.\n\nBefore she grew too sick to leave her bed, I remember her as full of energy. She worked cleaning and tending to the Galea Theatre — arranging the scenery, sweeping the seats, checking the lights and fittings — whatever needed doing. Because of her job, she heard every kind of opera there was. And when she came home, she'd sing. She loved singing. Whether she was resting or scrubbing the floors, there was always a tune on her lips. Simply by being there — listening day after day — I started to sing along with her.\n\nWe lived a modest life — but with music always in the air, somehow, it felt like enough. Until she fell ill. I can't remember exactly when it began, but I do remember that winter. It was one of the coldest winters in my memory, and her health suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse. Before, a few days' rest would be enough for her to recover. But that time, even as the snows melted and spring returned, she remained bedridden. The doctor said it was the result of a frail constitution and the wear and tear of years spent working too hard. There was no cure. All we could do was let her rest — and hope for the best.\n\nWith Mother no longer able to work, the strain at home grew heavier with each passing day. One day, she called me over, her voice more serious than I had ever heard. She asked me to bring out a box from under the bed — one I had never seen before. It looked far too fine — far too out of place in our modest home. I was even more taken aback when I opened it:\nInside were a few pieces of ornate jewellery — each one looking far more valuable than anything we had ever owned. And at the centre of it all, nestled among the necklaces and bracelets, was a badge. Engraved upon it were the words \"Laurelled Charon\" — and Mother's name. I realised then that her past might have been far more complicated than I had ever imagined.\n\"Take these pieces of jewellery and sell them,\" she said. \"It should last us a while. But don't go by yourself — ask someone from the theatre to help. Otherwise, you might be taken advantage of.\"\nI nodded and carefully took the jewellery from the box. There were letters in there too — quite a few, in fact — but she glanced over and simply told me to leave them and put the box away.\nI didn't ask any questions. But she must have seen the curiosity in my eyes — because she spoke again: \"Just some old things... from the days when I still lived in the inner city.\"\n\"Mother... were you rich?\" I asked.\n\"If you mean in terms of money,\" she said, almost absently, as if dismissing some long-forgotten dream, \"then yes. There were always gorgeous gowns in my wardrobe — and if one ever got torn or stained, I never minded. There were always new ones waiting. I had enough jewellery to wear something different every day. And if I fancied something new, I never had to buy it myself. I'd just mention it at a ball, and a few days later, someone would bring it to my door in a ribboned box. All I had to do was dance with them once or twice. If I hadn't left the inner city, the house would probably be filled with flowers and expensive tonics by now.\"\n\nAs she spoke, the last of the sunlight brushed across her face. She looked beautiful — worn thin by time, yet touched with a fragile grace.\nI couldn't read her expression. Was it nostalgia? Was it regret?\n\n\"Mother... do you ever regret leaving the inner city?\" I asked.\n\"Regret?\" She smiled — and somehow, that smile made her look all the more fragile, all the more beautiful. \"Those ten years I spent in the inner city... they were like soap bubbles in the sun — gleaming, shimmering, and gone the moment you tried to hold them. Sometimes I even wonder if they ever truly happened at all.\"\n\"But the days I spent after I left — the life I built here — every moment of it was real. I remember the day I first learned the layout of the theatre, and the moment I knew by heart where every tool belonged. I remember when I dressed the entire auditorium by myself. I remember the first callus on my hand. The first ache in my knees. The first wrinkle at the corner of my eye.\"\nShe reached out and touched my cheek. Her palm was roughened by time, but it carried nothing but warmth. \"And I remember you, Parsifal. The first time you sang along with me. The first time you memorised an entire score. The first time you sang through a whole act without missing a note.\"\n\"I have never once regretted leaving the inner city.\" She looked into my eyes, her voice steady with quiet sincerity. \"It was the best decision I ever made.\"\n\nI don't know much about the inner city. I could never quite picture what life there might have been like. But I believe her.

  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11030402": "I still remember the first time Mother took me to the theatre. It was early spring, and for once, Icelake had a clear sky. The snow had melted, and the streets smelled fresh and clean. She held my hand as we walked.\n\n\"Mother, what's a 'theatre'?\" I asked.\n\"It's where people perform operas,\" she said. \"An opera is... well, people take on roles from a story, and instead of just acting, they sing it.\"\n\"Like when you and I sing together at home?\"\n\"Something like that — but not quite. You'll understand once you see it,\" she said with a warm smile.\n\nAs a child, the theatre was the most magnificent building I had ever seen. Outside the grand entrance, elegantly dressed men and women stepped down from velvet-lined carriages. I felt like a shepherd boy who had stumbled into a palace.\n\nMother led me through a side door and introduced me to Madam Putsch, head of the Magic Flute Troupe. They seemed like old acquaintances — Madam Putsch had been the one to help my mother find her job. While they spoke, a beautiful woman peeked through the backstage door — then, in a flash, she was right in front of me, vigorously ruffling my hair.\n\n\"Aww! What a charming little gentleman! You must be Herzeleide's boy, right? Look at those eyes — you're the spitting image of your mother!\"\n\nThat was the first thing Miss Violetta — who would later become my mentor — ever said to me. To be honest, I didn't think much of her at first. She seemed overly theatrical — and ruffling my hair without even asking first felt incredibly rude. The rest of the troupe struck me as strange too. Feeling out of place, I tucked myself into a corner of the lounge as soon as my mother started working, and sat there quietly on my own.\n\nI didn't know how long I'd been asleep before Madam Putsch woke me. She told me the day's performances were over, and that only the troupe was left in the building. I was free to wander the stage and the auditorium if I liked. Truth be told, all I really wanted was to crawl back into my corner and go on sleeping. But it felt rude to turn down her kindness, so I dragged myself towards the stage.\n\nSomewhere beyond the stage, a faint song began to drift through the air. I remembered what my mother had said — about people singing stories instead of just acting them. Could this be opera? I followed the voice, step by step, as it grew steadily clearer — until at last, only a curtain remained between us.\nLater, I would learn it was the main stage drape — not just any curtain.\nCurious, I tugged the curtain aside, and brilliant light spilled across my face, dazzling me. There she was — Miss Violetta, standing alone in the spotlight. But... was it really her?\n\nAs she moved gracefully around the stage, a living forest seemed to take shape in the empty space:\nShe lifted her hem and tiptoed forward — like crossing a babbling brook.\nWhen she ducked her head and brushed aside her hair, it was as if a low branch had caught playfully at her curls.\nShe raised two fingers to her lips and winced, as if tasting a wild, tart berry.\nAnd when she smiled tenderly with quiet wonder and reached out her hand, it was to greet a deer hidden among the trees.\n\nHer clothes hadn't changed, nor had her face. She was still that same abrupt woman who had tousled my hair without so much as a by-your-leave. And yet, standing there, I could have sworn she was someone else entirely.\n\n\"Oh?\"\nHer eyes caught on me. She approached, her steps light and graceful. Bending low, she drew the curtain wider, bringing her face level with mine. \"Are you lost, sweetheart? The forest can be a dangerous place. Let me show you the way out.\"\n\"Are you... Miss Violetta?\" I asked hesitantly.\nShe widened her eyes in confusion, and shook her head.\n\"You've mistaken me for someone else. I'm White Rose. I live in a windmill cottage — east of the forest, west of the lake.\"\n\nMy mother had taught me to sing for as long as I could remember. But it was then, hidden behind the curtain, that I first dreamed of becoming an opera performer.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_11030403": "After being barred from performing, I turned to my teacher for help — to take me into the inner city, in search of my birth father, Morris Glenville.\n\nI found his name while clearing out Mother's belongings after she passed away. She had never spoken of him while she was alive. Of course, I had asked about my father once when I was little, but she had only given me a blank look and said, \"I don't know.\" I imagine there were memories too painful for her to revisit. If I hadn't been utterly out of options, I would never have considered turning to that man.\n\nBut I truly had no other choice. We all want art to be just art — pure, untouched by the hypocrisy and prejudice of the world. But in Icelake, that's a dream as fragile as a snowflake — delicate, fleeting, and quick to vanish.\n\nI stood for a long time in front of the grand estate, gathering all the courage I had before finally pressing the doorbell. A maid answered. She told me Mr Glenville wasn't home and wouldn't be back that day, then closed the door with quiet finality. I lingered there for a moment, the winter wind slicing against my cheeks. I was just about to leave when I heard a girl's voice:\n\"Give my Mr White Bird back... please...\"\n\nShe sounded sad — desperate, even. It was a tone I knew all too well. I didn't need to see her face to know how helpless she must have felt. Without thinking, I hurried toward the voice, circling around to the back of the house. Suddenly, a flash of white came tumbling down from above. I caught it by reflex — soft, warm, as if it had wrapped me in a gentle embrace. It was a plush white bird, nearly half my height: round, puffy, and a little comical, like something out of a storybook. I figured this must be \"Mr White Bird.\"\n\n\"Hah — looks like he ran off,\" came a shrill, mocking voice from the balcony above. \"Guess he didn't like you much, huh?\"\nIt was the maid.\nI heard frantic little footsteps scurrying away. A door slammed somewhere upstairs, cutting the sound short. Silence fell — and then, faintly, came the soft sound of a little girl quietly sobbing from the balcony.\n\"...Mr White Bird...\"\nI stepped out of the shadows, the plush bird nestled against my chest, and edged closer until she came into view.\n\nShe couldn't have been more than twelve or thirteen, with snow-white hair and sapphire eyes — like the young heroine of a fairy tale. And to my surprise, she was Charon. Morris Glenville was Solarian, which could only mean he had married a Charon woman. The thought gave me a sliver of hope: If he already had a Charon child... maybe he wouldn't turn me away either.\n\nThe girl spotted me and froze mid-step. I put a finger to my lips, signalling her to keep quiet, then steadied myself and tossed the plush bird back toward the balcony. (Thank you, Dennis, for forcing me into endless games of catch with your little siblings — without that training, I would never have made the throw.)\n\nShe caught Mr White Bird against her chest. The doll was soft and light, but even so, the force of it sent her stumbling. She dropped to her knees with a small thud, then scrambled upright again, clutching the doll close, her eyes shining with pure joy.\nShe mouthed a silent, heartfelt \"Thank you.\"\n\nI nodded and made to leave — but before I could turn away, she began waving her arms in an excited, frantic series of gestures I couldn't quite decipher. Then, without a word, she vanished back inside. I hesitated, lingering there in the cold. A minute later, she reappeared on the balcony, clutching something small. She tossed it down — a square of paper, neatly folded.\n\nI caught it, unfolded it carefully, and found a simple sketch inside: a boy holding a white bird aloft. It took me a moment to realise — she had drawn me. At the bottom, in careful, elegant handwriting, it said: \"Thank you, big brother! You're so kind!\"\n\nBig brother.\nThe words struck harder than I expected. In that instant, I realised — yes, I suppose she really was my little sister.\n\nI tucked the little drawing carefully into my coat pocket, then dipped into a deep, theatrical bow — just like a storybook fairy granting the heroine's wish.\nShe giggled.\nAnd just then, a quiet thought bloomed inside me: I'd make a good big brother. I would read her fairy tales by the fire. I would play dolls with her. I would tell her how wonderful her drawings were. I would sing her lullabies when she couldn't sleep. And if she ever wanted, I would teach her to sing.\n\nBut that little fantasy melted the instant I came face-to-face with Morris Glenville — as fast as snow vanishing against bare skin. Looking back, it should have been obvious: If that girl had ever been truly cherished in the Glenville house, no servant would have dared to treat her that way. I should've known.\n\nI could never be her big brother. There was nothing I could offer her, nothing I could change. She and I were the same — two children trapped in separate cages, both dreaming of a sky we could never reach.",

Honestly, I hadn't even noticed Icelake had such a beacon. Yet whenever he spoke of it, I always pictured something golden and warm — a light that would settle gently on your head, just like sunlight.\n\nAfter he died, I decided to visit the inner city.

And when I finally reached the top, there it was: the light Blues had always talked about.\n\nI was disappointed.\n\nIt was just a lamp. Large, yes — but otherwise ordinary. Its beam was cold, pale, almost clinical. Dust caked its housing, and its motor hummed with an irritating whine.\n\nWhat a fool, I thought. To chase something like this. To give up everything for it. To die for it.\n\nBut on my way back down, I stopped and looked up again.\n\nUp there, against the night sky, the light still shone. And I realised something: from down here, it actually wasn't half bad. No one could hear the motor's whir from the ground. No one could see the dust.

Only through whispered conversations between trusted friends could one learn of the Ferrymen — and where to find her.\n\nAt first, it was only those few Charons who still clung to the old ways that dared make the journey — on foot, through the forest — to ask the Ferrywoman to send off a lost loved one. But as resentment towards the patricians of the Church deepened, this quiet funeral rite became something more: a silent act of rebellion.

For by dawn, the child's fever had vanished, her wounds had miraculously closed, and horns, like Nifle's, had begun to grow.\n\nNifle raised her as her own, hoping they might share the long years ahead. But the child aged — as all mortals do. And in time, she no longer looked like Nifle's daughter, but her sister, her mother, her grandmother.\n\nAnd Nifle came to understand: the miracles she could bring into the world were finite. The road to immortality is a narrow one. The gods had granted her passage. But they had not granted her company.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_15020305": "They say dreams are shaped by the desires buried deep within one's mind. Perhaps that is why Nifle rarely dreams — there is nothing left in this world that calls to her.\n\nAnd yet, once in a while, she dreams of her parents. Their faces have long since faded with time, but she still remembers how it felt — to hold her father's calloused hand, to gaze into the soft, half-closed eyes of her mother. That feeling, she knows, was called \"warmth.\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_15020401": "The whispers of fallen soldiers filled her ears — rage, resentment, sorrow, regret... All of it swirled like a dense fog, veiling the sun in shadow. And yet, each time, the voices quieted at the hush of her song, dissolving into the trailing folds of her gown as she danced.\n\nDeep within the Slumbering Woods, many souls still wandered. The ritual had taken longer than usual. When Nifle finally came to a stop, a breeze stirred her veil. It had been months since the battle. The scent of blood had long since faded — now, only the earthy breath of leaf and soil filled her lungs. She closed her eyes and turned her face to the wind, allowing herself to feel the land once more.\n\n\"Each land has its own breath.\" It was a line she had once read. Now, standing once again on this soil after decades away, she finally understood what it meant. In that peaceful moment, wrapped in the fragrance of memory, her thoughts wandered to a time long past — quiet walks through the woods, always a few steps behind that bright figure, laughter light and silver as windchimes.\n\nA rustle of footsteps stirred the stillness. She opened her eyes. Among the trees — a flicker of colour. A girl stood before her, cradling a bundle of wildflowers. For a heartbeat, the figure seemed to blur — overlapping with someone long lost to memory. Her face carried a resemblance Nifle hadn't seen in years. And for a moment, she thought she heard the girl call her name — soft, joyful, like a voice drifting through a dream.\n\nThen the vision passed. The girl blinked, curious. \"Hello, ma'am,\" she said politely. \"I don't think I've seen you around before. Are you from far away?\"\n\nHer voice rippled through Nifle's thoughts like a pebble cast into still water, drawing her gently back to the present. Nifle smiled gently. \"Yes, my child. From a very long way away.\"\n\n\"But... you sounded like someone from around here.\"\n\n\"When I said 'a very long way,'\" Nifle raised a hand and gestured to the horizon, \"I did not mean distance.\"\n\nThe girl tilted her head, puzzled — but her gaze soon drifted to the lantern in Nifle's hand, its pale glow pulsing like breath.\n\n\"Are you a Ferrywoman?\" she asked. \"Did you come for... the departed?\"\n\nNifle nodded. \"I've just guided the wandering souls of this forest to the Misty Sea.\"\n\nThe girl lowered her gaze, and a note of sorrow crept into her voice. \"...They were my people,\" she murmured. \"The people of Aethyrie could not kneel to Hyperborea's rule. Nor return to the gods who turned their backs on us. So we stood — shoulder to shoulder — and fought for freedom and dignity, with nothing but our flesh and blood. Some called it foolish. Reckless. Pointless. But I don't believe that. Do you, ma'am? If we lost the war... does that mean their sacrifice meant nothing?\"\n\n\"All lives must end,\" Nifle said softly. \"But thoughts endure. The fallen lie like monuments left incomplete — someday, freedom will come to carve their names where they belong.\"\nShe paused, as if remembering someone.\n\"Those were the words of an old friend. I hope they bring you some comfort.\"\n\n\"Your friend must have been very brave,\" the girl said with a smile. \"Thank you — for guiding them home. Now they can finally rest in peace.\"\n\nShe bent to place the wildflowers at the roots of an old tree. After a quiet moment, she rose and turned to leave — but paused, glancing back.\n\n\"My grandmother once told me a story about a Ferrywoman in a black veil, carrying a lantern... gentle as the night itself. You remind me of her.\"\n\nYou remind me of your grandmother, too, Nifle thought. But she kept the words to herself.\n\nInstead, she offered a soft smile and bowed her head.\n\n\"It's time I moved on. May Mother Embla bless you, my child.\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_15020402": "\"Who is that Ferrywoman?\"\n\"She's Lady Aletheia's mother.\"\n\"What...? But she looks so young.\"\n\"That's because she bears the magic of longevity. She never ages.\"\n\"Wait — that's real? That's... incredible. Must be nice.\"\n\"But... to outlive your own child — to say goodbye with your own hands... that must hurt more than anything.\"\n\nThough the whispers were hushed, they still reached Nifle's ears, carried on the evening breeze. Yet the words stirred nothing in her. She had long grown used to the awe, the envy, the wonder — and the quiet sighs that followed wherever she walked.\n\n\"It's time,\" said the young attendant beside her. \"The rite is ready.\"\n\nNifle gave a slight nod. She lifted her lantern and stepped toward the river, where the water glowed faintly beneath the night sky. Moored at the bank was a slender boat — and resting upon it, a delicately carved coffin.\n\nThe woman within lay surrounded by blossoms, her eyes peacefully closed — as if merely dozing in a sunlit chair. The years had carved themselves into her: fine lines by her eyes and lips, skin dulled and weathered, strands of grey falling soft beside her temples. To any other, she was a woman well into her twilight years. But to Nifle, she was still a child. Through that aged face, she could still see all her past selves — the bright-eyed little girl with laughter full of wonder, the quiet student lost in the lamp-lit hush of the library, the slender figure crossing battle lines for her nation's survival, the silver-haired scholar who stood at the lectern, her eyes softened by time, yet shining still.\n\nNifle had expected deep grief — the kind she had once felt when guiding old friends to the other shore. But in this moment, what rose within her was something quieter: a strange sense of calm and release.\n\nOne by one, she lit the candles arranged around the coffin. Then, from the folds of her robe, she drew a small stone — its surface ridged and grooved with cracks — and placed it gently upon the woman's chest.\n\nIt was a fragment of a meteor — and the fulfilment of a promise long kept. That day, Nifle had planned a rare visit to the market — and asked if her child wanted anything. The girl — truly just a little one then — had lit up, eyes sparkling as she clutched at Nifle's sleeve. \"A talking star,\" she'd said.\n\nOf course, no market could offer up a star — let alone one that spoke. The child had always been full of whimsical, impossible ideas. But Nifle had promised she would find one, someday.\n\nChildren forget the promises made to them when they are very young. But Nifle never forgot the one she made to her daughter.\n\n\"I've brought you your talking star, Aleth,\" she whispered.\n\nNifle had once read Aletheia's journals. As a child, Aletheia held fast to her own odd beliefs. She didn't believe the priests of Elysium, who said the stars were gemstones set into a vast glass dome — arching over the world, and known to all as \"the sky.\" Nor did she accept the tales of the Charon, who claimed the stars were golden leaves hanging from the limbs of a great world tree. She believed that each distant star was its own world — like Atlasia itself. And perhaps, to those stars, Atlasia was one of them — a single speck of light, twinkling back across the void.\n\nIf that were true, then this meteor shard — lined with ancient veins — might still whisper of a distant world, across time and space.\n\nNifle looked down, one last time, at the elderly woman who had once been her child. Then, gently, she closed the coffin. With steady hands, she pushed the boat into the river, letting the current carry it away. She rose — and with the same grace etched into every motion, began the Dance of Departure.\n\nBehind her, soft sobbing stirred the air. In the edge of her gaze, the crowd stood still upon the riverbank — heads slightly bowed, their eyes fixed on the drifting boat in silent reverence. Candlelight shimmered in their eyes, a scattering of stars upon the earth.\n\nAnd in that moment, Nifle understood: The child had stopped asking for stars — not because she had forgotten, but because she had become one. A quiet light above Aethyrie's sky, eternal and unwavering, illuminating the path ahead.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_15020403": "\"Have a sip too, sweetheart.\" The older woman walking beside Nifle offered her a waterskin with a kind smile.\n\"Thank you.\" Nifle accepted it and took a sip — then immediately doubled over, coughing hard as the burn hit her throat.\n\"Hehe, should've warned you — that's wine.\" The woman chuckled. \"Cold weather like this, a few sips can warm you right up. But if you're not used to the taste, maybe don't overdo it. Wouldn't want you dizzy later.\"\nNifle gave an awkward smile and handed the waterskin back. The woman patted her lightly on the shoulder, then turned to check in on the others.\n\nAmong the migrants, aside from Erika and Alexis, no one knew that the quiet, delicate girl walking among them was the \"blessed girl\" once worshipped upon the altar. For the first time in her life, Nifle found herself living as an ordinary person — with friends, with companions.\n\nTheir journey began beneath the shadow of the Sacred Tower, passed through the Emerald Forest, and continued ever northward. Here, the trees shed their yellowed leaves at the first bite of cold. The north was nothing like the sun-blessed southern lands, those long favoured by the gods. And yet, even here, Nifle felt something within her begin to thaw. Her dearest wish now was to fulfil the promise she had made to Erika: to find a place where they could live freely, and build a new home.\n\nBut that wish was too much to ask of the times. The knights of Elysium gave relentless chase, outnumbering the migrants many times over and wielding weapons far more refined. Again and again, they launched assaults. And each time Erika returned from battle, her body bore new wounds.\n\n\"Let me go in your place,\" Nifle said. \"I can't be hurt.\"\nBut Erika only smiled and shook her head. \n\"I have to go,\" she said. \"No one else can take my place.\"\n\nErika's final battle was fought not against kings or gods — but against her own father. On that day, Lord Generous himself led the charge, declaring a crusade against his daughter in the name of purging heresy. The tragic clash between father and daughter ended with both falling upon the field. At the very moment his sacred bow, Mammon, sent an arrow through her chest — Erika's lance found his heart.\n\nWhen Nifle found Erika amid the wreckage, the warrior was already fading — her breath shallow, life slipping away. In desperation, Nifle reached for her dagger, ready to slice open her own wrist. The blood in her veins — the so-called \"golden blood\" — had once repelled death itself. But Erika, though barely conscious, raised a trembling hand to stop her.\n\n\"This wound is fatal,\" she whispered, voice faint but firm. \"Even if you kept me alive... I would never truly recover.\"\n\n\"I can keep you alive forever!\" Nifle cried.\n\nBut Erika only shook her head. \"That wouldn't count as living. I want to die a warrior — here, on the battlefield. I'm sorry... but I won't be able to go with you... to that land of freedom we dreamed of.\"\n\n\"Why...?\" Nifle bowed her head, tears spilling freely as she trembled from head to toe. \"This blood in my veins — it's meant to save lives, isn't it? So why can't I save you? If I can't even save you... then what's the point of my life?\"\n\n\"Nifle...\" Erika reached out, gently cupping her friend's tear-streaked cheek with a calloused hand hardened by years on the battlefield. \"That bastard of a father of mine... he might've been right about one thing. You really are a child blessed by the gods. Your life... must have a very special purpose. And I believe... you'll find it someday.\"\n\nBut Nifle didn't understand. Not then. All she could do was hold her friend's body, already growing cold, and let the tears fall, unrestrained.\n\nAfter Erika's passing, the migrants continued northward. Their journey stretched on — long enough to shake off the knights of Elysium, and longer still, until at last, they were free. But in the end, arms that once embraced drew blades against one another, and wine once shared spilt into blood-soaked soil. The road to freedom was lined with thorns and littered with broken oaths. Nifle witnessed more sorrow. More partings. But she also began to understand: Though life was full of uncertainty, and death inevitable, the brave still had the right to choose — what to live for, and what to die for. Death held no meaning... until they gave it one. That was the privilege of mortals.\n\nBut that privilege eluded Nifle. She could not choose death. She could only live — and keep living — as everything she loved faded, one by one, before her eyes.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_15020404": "She felt as though she were caught in a cycle that never ended.\n\nEvery morning, at the same hour, Lord Generous' maids would open the door to her chamber, unfasten the chains at her wrists and ankles, and draw a white veil over her face. She would walk, step by step, toward the sanctum throne — bathed in reverent gazes, her feet treading soft petals scattered in her path — just as a true Divine Herald was meant to do.\n\nThen Lord Generous himself would step forward, presenting a chest of glass phials — clear, flawless, and empty. And the rite of blessing would begin.\n\nShe was the chosen of the gods. And as such, she was expected to transcend mortal pain. That was why the blood had to be drawn in the oldest way — no fine needles, no herbs to dull the pain. Such things would profane the rite, reduce it to something clinical, something cruel.\n\nThe blade must be beautiful. Silver, gilded, engraved with the crest of the golden iris. Cold as the sanctum's stone, sharp enough to part flesh with the gentlest touch. Blood, deep and red, would slide into the phial. And with it came that sickly-sweet metallic scent. It was anything but divine, yet the heavy incense of the sanctum would quickly drown the scent out.\n\nOne phial would fill. Then another. And another. Until the grateful praises of the faithful blurred into a far-off murmur, and the blade slipped from her grasp.\n\nThe gates of the sanctum would close with a thunderous boom, sealing out the desperate eyes beyond. She — now little more than a hollowed vessel — would be carried back to her chamber by the maids, the veil lifted from her face. Then came hours of stillness. Eyes wide open, she could only watch as the wounds on her arm slowly closed, as pale skin flushed faintly with life once more, as the cracks on her fingers knit together with impossible precision.\n\nAnd so, she was made whole again — no different from the day before, or the one before that. Waiting to be veiled once more. Waiting for the next chest of gleaming, empty phials. Waiting.\n\nThat day, footsteps came outside her chamber door earlier than usual. It wasn't uncommon. Whenever important guests visited, Lord Generous would instruct the maids to prepare an extra supply of \"golden blood.\"\n\nBut this time, there was only one set of footsteps — and a voice she'd never heard before. Bright. Unfamiliar. Full of life. It spoke softly from beyond the curtain.\n\"Hello? Um... are you the Divine Herald?\"\nShe sat up at the sound, but gave no reply.\n\n\"Hey! You're awake!\" The voice brightened. \"I'm Erika. My father said I'm not supposed to come in here, but... well, I thought you must be bored. I mean, being stuck in this room all the time? That sounds awful. Don't you want to go outside? Just for a little while? It's still early — no one will notice.\"\n\nShe opened her mouth, trying to respond — but the long-silent cords had forgotten how to make sound.\n\n\"Hmm? Is this not a good time?\" The voice hesitated for a moment. Then brightened again. \"That's fine! I'll come back another day then!\"\n\nNo. Don't leave.\n\nDragging her weakened body forward, the chains that bound her limbs scraped against the bedframe, grinding out a jarring, metallic screech. Her throat trembled with effort. A sound broke free — rough, hoarse, barely human.\n\"Hel...\"\n\"Miss Herald...? Did you say something?\"\n\"He... help... me...\" She forced the words out, one broken breath at a time.\n\"Hmm?\"\nThere was a pause. Then the curtain flew open. And she came in — bringing sunlight, wind, and the scent of a world still full of life.\n\nLater, Nifle learned that Erika was the daughter of Lord Generous himself. After uncovering the truth behind the so-called \"golden blood,\" Erika began visiting her in secret at dawn. She would bring food, teach her to speak, and share stories of the world beyond those locked doors.\n\"Miss Herald — no, Nifle. I'll get you out of here. I promise.\" She said it one day, her eyes meeting Nifle's without hesitation, her voice steady and sincere. Nifle had thought it no more than a kind lie — a moment's warmth, meant to ease her pain. But Erika kept her promise.\n\nOn the day of their escape, Erika unshackled Nifle's chains and lifted her onto her back. Though they were the same age, Nifle's body was so light, so fragile, she weighed no more than a child.\n\"You're light as a feather...\" Erika murmured. \"When we reach the north, I'll make sure you eat well. You'll grow stronger. We'll ride horses together. We'll learn to shoot arrows together.\"\n\"Okay,\" Nifle whispered, and nodded, a faint smile curling her lips.\n\nMany years later, whenever Nifle found herself leafing through the history books of Atlasia, her mind would return to the night she fled the sanctum of Lord Generous. She had ridden on Erika's horse, arms wrapped tightly around her rescuer's waist. Unlike Nifle's paper-thin skin, Erika's waist — firm from years of training — felt solid and sure. It made Nifle feel safe.\nThey galloped through the night, the wind roaring in her ears, the city fading behind them. The horse finally came to a stop at a camp, where Nifle met Erika's comrades for the first time. She looked at the faces gathered around the fire — faces marked by warriors' bold laughter, by farmers' sun-etched furrows, by scholars' brows drawn deep in thought, and bards' lips cracked by years of song. The firelight danced in their eyes. To Nifle, they were nothing like the faces she had seen from high above the altar. \nTheir eyes burned just as brightly — but not with desperate prayers begging for divine mercy. No — the fire in their eyes spoke of longing. A longing not to be saved, but to build a new homeland with their own hands and feet planted firmly in the earth.\n\nTogether with Erika's companions, Nifle became part of a far greater escape — one that later generations would remember as the Great Migration. A chapter of history so profound, no retelling could ever truly capture its weight. It was a movement born of defiance. The people of Elysium's lower castes, no longer willing to kneel beneath the yoke of theocracy, placed their faith in a wise leader and marched north — into the uncharted wilds, in search of something they could finally call their own.\n\nAnd for Nifle, it was the same. She had escaped the sanctum and stepped into life — not as a symbol, nor a vessel, but as herself.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_15020405": "Deep in the forest, a young girl awoke beneath the dappled sunlight. Two bright red berries dangled before her eyes, gently swaying. A drop of dew slid down their plump skin and fell.\n\"Wha— !?\" The girl jolted fully awake and scrambled up from the grass. \"Has the hunt started already?\"\nHer father chuckled, holding the berries between his fingers. \"You begged to come along first thing this morning — and then fell asleep on my back halfway through. Hunt's over, sweetheart. Time to head home.\"\n\"Aww, I missed it all!\" she pouted, cheeks puffed out. \"Why didn't you wake me up?\"\n\"Alright, alright — next time, I promise,\" he said, giving the berries a little shake. \"Here. These are sweet. Try one — might cheer you up.\"\nStill sceptical, the girl took one and popped it into her mouth. A hint of tartness mingled with the sweetness as the juice spread across her tongue, and the gloom lifted from her face.\n\"What are these berries called?\" she asked.\n\"Those are raspberries. Forest's full of wild fruits — but only a few you can eat. And raspberries? Sweetest of the lot.\"\nThe girl snatched another handful from his palm and tugged at his hand, ready to head home.\n\"Daddy, I want more...\"\n\"Alright, two more — okay, three. But the rest's for your mum, okay?\"\n\"Why are raspberries so small? Wouldn't it be better if they were bigger?\"\n\"Well, you just have to wait till it grows up. First it turns into a gooseberry, then into an apple. And if that apple keeps growing... bam — melon.\"\n\"Wow... then what will I become when I grow up?\"\nHer father chuckled, gave her hair a gentle ruffle, but said nothing.\nAt the end of the path, a small wooden house came into view. That was the girl's home. Her mother stood at the door, waving at them from afar. With a joyful squeal, the girl let go of her father's hand and ran toward her mother's open arms.\n\"Goodness, look at you,\" her mother said, catching her and wiping the juice from her mouth. \"You didn't sneak something into your tummy in the woods, did you?\"\n\"She didn't, I can vouch for her,\" her father said, chuckling as he walked up behind them. He pulled out a bundle of raspberries wrapped in a handkerchief and handed them to his wife. \"We brought some back for you too.\"\n\"Wow... they're so pretty, I almost feel bad eating them,\" she said with a smile.\nLaughing and chatting, the man and the woman walked off toward the kitchen to start preparing lunch.\nMeanwhile, the girl slipped away again, wandering down to a nearby brook. As she murmured the list of fruits her father had told her — raspberries, gooseberries, apples, and melons — mounds of them rose in her mind like tiny hills, one after another.\nThen suddenly—\n\"Whoa...!\"\nThe girl froze, eyes wide. Just within reach, a dragonfly spiralled down from the air and settled lightly on the tip of a tightly closed water lily bud. Its delicate wings caught the sunlight, scattering it into a shimmer of iridescent colour.\nShe held her breath, perfectly still — afraid that even the faintest motion might send the tiny, beautiful creature fluttering away.\n\nBack then, she longed to grow up. Everything was new in her eyes, and the world before her — vast, unknown — was filled with wonder.\nBack then, she didn't yet know she would one day witness every bloom and every withering, every meeting and every parting, every beginning — and every end.\nBack then, she was simply an ordinary child, watching a dragonfly perch on the tip of a water lily bud, her eyes bright with joy and wonder.",

The social elite buzzed with speculation about which lady of stature he would choose. Yet, against all expectations, he chose a widow with no means to her name.\nThe widow's family had once been among Icelake's oldest and most distinguished, but their glory had long since faded, leaving behind little more than a noble title. Worse still, her deceased husband had been branded a criminal for his adherence to the forbidden Elysian faith, and her daughter was a lowly Charon.\nThe gossip mills churned with theories about Glenville's unexpected choice of bride. Some romantics believed it was because the widow's beauty rivalled that of a leading opera diva; shrewd businessmen speculated she might possess a vast, secret fortune; and tabloid journalists claimed that Glenville, shunned by the snobbish old nobility for his humble roots, had strategically aligned himself with a fallen but aristocratic lineage. Meanwhile, those who favoured darker tales hinted at sorcery, claiming the widow's Charon daughter had ensnared the wealthy industrialist with dark magic to usurp his fortune.\nThe truth, however, remained shrouded in mystery.

The household staff knew only that it was intricately locked, accessible solely by a secret code passed down only through direct descendants.

How does one even start a fire in such a downpour?\"\nYet, the allure of a sensational tale always triumphs over minor inconsistencies. As the story was retold, it morphed, eventually placing all blame for the family's misfortunes squarely on the Charon girl. Her purported hatred for her stepfather and Mortalan siblings supposedly drove her to unleash endless misfortunes on her family through her wicked magic.\n\"But where did the girl end up?\" someone wondered.\n\"Who knows? Probably living with the rats in the sewers by now. Better watch out on your nighttime strolls, folks — she might snatch you for a midnight snack!\"\nLaughter filled the tavern, echoing merrily against the clink of glasses.",

  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_18010401": "From the hazy memories of her early childhood, Fina recalls a phrase her parents often mentioned with profound reverence — \"The Elysian Canon.\"\nUnaware of its meaning, she asked with the lisp of a toddler, \"What is that, Mommy?\"\n”It's what Mommy and Daddy believe in,\" her mother explained, \"All of us — Mortalans and Charons alike — were sculpted by the earliest deities from the sacred tree. The tree's branches formed our bodies, its leaves our hair, and its sap our souls. Every sentient creature in this world possesses a soul of equal worth.\"\nLittle Fina, with confusion clouding her young face, struggled with the concepts of \"Mortalans,\" \"Charons,\" and \"souls\" — words far too complex for a three-year-old to grasp. Sensing Fina's bewilderment, her mother gently stroked her hair and picked up a storybook from the shelf. She sketched two figures: one with a regular head and another with two horns protruding from the forehead.\n\"See, this one is a Mortalan, and this one is a sprite. They come from different families. Their families told them they were born to be enemies because they look different.\"\n\"But... why can't they be friends?\" Fina asked softly, biting her lower lip.\n\"They couldn't do that, at least not at first. But one day, a fairy gave them each a book called the Elysian Canon. Through it, they realised that their souls were no different from each other's, and that they were meant to cherish and love each other instead of fighting.\"\n\"Ah... so it's like Mommy and Daddy!” Fina exclaimed, beginning to understand. \"Daddy has horns, and Mommy doesn't. But you still love each other, and you had me.\"\n\"Yes, my dear,\" her mother smiled, tenderly kissing Fina on the forehead. \"Just like how Mommy loves Daddy, and how we love you.\"\nFina's fairy tale began with the \"Elysian Canon,\" but in the end, it was also the very reason things fell apart.\nOne night, the guards of Icelake burst into Fina's home unannounced, ransacking the place with brutal efficiency. Fina's mother hid with her in a cramped space beneath the basement, listening as the soldiers' boots pounded the floor above like a relentless storm. Fina could hear her father arguing desperately with the guards, fragments of heated words reaching her ears — something about \"illegal possession of Elysian scriptures\" and \"worshipping false Elysian gods\"... Then came sounds of a scuffle and the heavy thud of a body hitting the floor... Her mother clamped a hand over her mouth, silencing her screams and cries as Fina held her breath, clutching her fear tightly.\n\"Daddy's gone to a faraway place. He's not coming back,\" Fina's mother whispered to her, her voice trembling as she looked around the house left in shambles after the search that night.\nIt was then that Fina understood — Papa Nightingale had fallen. Her fairy tale had come to an end.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_18010402": "\"Fizz—\"\nFina's mother struck a match, and a tiny, cheerful flame danced to life atop the blue candle, casting a gentle glow over the small cake. This was Fina's first birthday celebrated within the grand walls of this mansion.\nFina and her mother had been living in this opulent home for several years now. The house resembled something out of a fairy tale, with golden crystal chandeliers casting dreamlike patterns on the luxurious wallpaper. Each time the chandeliers were lit, Fina was reminded of the circus she had seen as a child — particularly the iron cages where the animals waited before their performances. The heavy brass lock on those cages, shimmering in the sunlight, seemed almost identical in hue to the chandeliers.\nIn this beautiful mansion, \"birthdays\" were a privilege reserved for her younger half-siblings. Fina usually snuck into the parlour after the lively parties ended, hoping to coax a plain piece of cake, stripped of chocolate and fruit toppings, from the maids. But today, with the master of the house away on business, Fina finally had a birthday celebration to call her own.\n\"Happy birthday, Fina!\" her mother said with a warm smile.\nFina's eyelids fluttered, trying to muster a smile as joyful as her mother's. Yet, her eyes couldn't help but linger on the bruises marring her mother's arms. Those weren't accidents — they were the marks left by her stepfather's cane. The man's temper was erratic: a spike in Phoxene prices, a business deal gone sour, a losing hand at cards, or even something as trivial as an unpalatable tea could set him off. And when he did, his fury was often directed at his Charon stepdaughter, whether or not she had anything to do with his frustrations. When Fina's mother intervened to protect her, she too bore the brunt of his rage, as evidenced by the stark marks left by his cane.\nThis brave mother, though adorned in finery, was like a canary trapped in a gilded cage, struggling even to protect her own fledgeling. Yet, despite everything, Fina was not afraid. Though her mother belonged to the mansion by day — to its master, Fina's half-siblings, the clink of glasses in the parlour, and the rustle of silk in the ballroom — at night, she belonged to Fina. Every night, her mother would steal up to the small attic room, sit by Fina's bed, and tell her wonderful bedtime stories, humming lullabies until she drifted into dreams.\nUnlike Fina, who was often tearful, her mother rarely cried. She didn't cry when she lost her parents and husband, nor during their funerals, which she organised all by herself. She didn't cry when forced into a strategic remarriage by greedy relatives, but instead made a deal with her new husband, trading her family heirlooms for the chance to keep Fina by her side. And she never cried when her new husband's fury rained down on her, even though her defiance only invited more insults and beatings. She would simply smile at Fina and whisper, \"Don't worry, the pain will go away soon.\"\nNoticing Fina's gaze, her mother subtly adjusted her shawl to cover the bruises and gently stroked Fina's hair. \"Make a wish, sweetie,\" she whispered. Fina nodded, closing her eyes, and silently wished, \"Dear God, please let me become as strong and brave as my mother.\"\nWhen she opened her eyes, her mother was gone, and a large white bird plush had taken her place. Its long, soft feathers were as white as Fina's snowy hair, and its wings spanned broader than her arms.\n\"Chirp chirp! Nice to meet you, Miss Fina — I'm your birthday gift!\" came her mother's voice from behind the plush. \"Let's be friends!\"\n\"Wow... hello, Mr White Bird!\" Fina exclaimed, stretching out her arms to hug the big bird tightly. The plush's soft feathers tickled her cheek, enveloping her in comforting warmth.\n\"He's like Daddy,\" Fina murmured softly. \"Daddy also had big, strong arms that could hold both Mommy and me.\"\nThey both knew which \"Daddy\" she was referring to, though it was left unsaid. After a brief pause, Fina suddenly heard quiet sobs. She quickly released the plush, peering around it to check on her mother. For the first time, she saw tears in her mother's eyes.\n\"I'm sorry, Fina...\" her mother sobbed, burying her face in her hands. \"I should have taken you away from here... I was foolish to think that you'd be better off in a whole family.\"\nLooking at her mother's gaunt face, Fina saw herself — the little girl who tried so hard to hold back tears and put on a brave face to spare her mother from worry. At that moment, Fina realised that her mother, too, had once been a little girl with childish giggles and tears of weakness, yet she had been holding back her tears and acting strong for her child.\n\"It's okay, Mommy,\" Fina said softly, pulling the plush's wide wings to envelop her mother. \"When I grow up, I'll have big, strong wings too. I will protect you.\"\nResolved to mature quickly for her mother's sake, Fina envisioned herself as a knight from her bedtime stories, strong enough to drive away all the villains. It was after this birthday that Fina first noticed a faint glimmer of magic at her fingertips.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_18010403": "\"I've finalised arrangements with the 6th Legion. I'll have someone take her there next week. Since she serves no purpose at home, perhaps in the Legion, she might get a chance to stand out and earn a few medals for us.\"\n\"What are you saying, Morris? She's only thirteen! How could you consider sending her to the army? She's a sickly child — she could die there!\"\n\"It's fine. The Legion is interested in her magic. A stint in the army might just toughen her up. And you'll have one less thing to worry about, so you can focus on taking care of our children.\"\n\"But...!\"\nTheir heated dispute reverberated through the parlour. Upstairs, hidden around a corner of the hallway, Fina clutched her white bird plush, her heart pounding as she eavesdropped, bewildered and scared.\nWhen Fina first discovered her magical powers, she had excitedly raced down from the attic to hug her mother and share the wonderful news. But her mother didn't seem pleased — her face was etched with worry, and she sternly warned Fina to keep her abilities hidden from others.\nFina figured it must be because she wasn't strong enough yet, and that her mother was worried for her safety. So, whenever she had the chance, she would secretly practice her magic in her room. With no textbooks or teachers, she turned to her storybooks for guidance, imagining the fairies as her mentors. Gradually, she learned to weave the fantastical \"friends\" from the fairy tales into reality.\nOne afternoon, while her mother and stepfather were away, Fina saw her little brother crying in the garden, with no servants around to comfort him. \"He must be very lonely and scared right now,\" Fina thought. After a moment's hesitation, she gathered her courage, walked over, and gently took his tiny hand in hers.\n\"Shh,\" Fina whispered, blowing gently on the back of his hand. \"It's okay. I have a little surprise for you, here—\"\nAs Fina opened her hand, several butterflies fluttered out from her palms, dancing gracefully around the garden, which had turned stark in the winter. The little boy, intrigued, clumsily chased the beautiful creatures, his tears turning to laughter. Magic could indeed bring happiness, Fina mused, watching her brother's cheerful face, unaware of the servant's cold gaze from the shadows.\nFina couldn't understand why the servant would report her magic abilities to her stepfather, just as she couldn't fathom why an organisation called the \"Legion\" would forcibly take gifted Charon children from their families.\nAmidst the loud arguments and the sound of shattering glass in the parlour, Fina realised one thing: magic — the powers that she had been granted to protect her mother — had led to their impending separation.\n\"Why did things have to turn out this way?\" she asked Mr White Bird.\nMr White Bird did not respond, gazing at Fina with his round, black eyes.\n\"If you could fly, would you take Mommy and me away from this house of pain?\"\nMr White Bird remained silent, his fluffy wings tenderly enveloping Fina.\nDeep into the night, Fina was roused from sleep by her mother. She didn't say a word, and only the aggressive pattering of rain against the attic window filled the silence. Bleary-eyed and confused, Fina noticed her mother was dressed in a dark, flowing cloak.\n\"Mommy, what's wrong?\" she murmured, \"Are we going somewhere?\"\n\"Yes, sweetie. I'm taking you to a new home,\" her mother replied softly, pulling her up and slipping a coat over her shoulders. \"It'll be like the cosy little cottage from your favourite storybooks.\"\n\"Is Mr White Bird coming with us?\" Fina asked.\nHer mother paused, a hint of sadness crossing her features. \"We need to travel light. I'm sorry, honey...\"\nRealisation dawned on Fina — this was not an ordinary outing, but an escape. \n\"Then let's leave Mr White Bird here to keep my brother and sister company,\" she proposed, securing the scarf her mother handed her. \"As long as I'm with Mommy, that's all that matters.\"\n\"My sweet baby,\" her mother whispered, tenderly stroking her child's hair. \"Once we're settled, Mommy will work hard to bring you more friends — not just Mr White Bird, but also puppies, ponies, butterflies... all the friends you like.\"\nFina nodded, then approached the door. Suddenly, she turned back, carefully tucking the plush under its blanket, making sure it wouldn't catch a chill.\n\"Goodbye, Mr White Bird,\" she whispered to the plush tenderly. \"Don't worry, I'll be with my Mommy. Take good care of yourself.\"\nFor a moment, she thought she saw Mr White Bird wink at her, his wings giving a soft flutter as if bidding her a safe journey, \"Chirp chirp, little nightingale, God-speed.\"\nTip-toeing after her mother, Fina silently descended the spiral staircase. One last time, she looked up at the crystal chandelier. In the gloom, it shimmered with a faint golden light, as if countless eyes were watching over her.\nAs they opened the door, a bolt of lightning split the sky, and the cold rain greeted them harshly. Fina couldn't help but shrink back. Her mother unfurled an umbrella, creating a small oasis of calm amid the storm. \"Let's go, Fina.\"\nThis call cleared all the fear and worries in Fina's mind. Clutching her mother's hand, Fina braved the rain.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_18010404": "\"Fina, I'm home—\"\nAs night fell, with the wind howling and snow swirling outside, Outsider pushed open the wooden door adorned with a small bird motif, carrying a bag of discounted groceries he had carefully picked out from a street vendor.\nThis small, humble house was Fina's new home.\nIn this simple dwelling, there were no beautiful dresses, fine china, or glittering gold... Yet it was a place where she no longer had to worry about stumbling over the hem of her long dress while trying to curtsey, endure cold leftovers served on elegant plates, or fear a thrashing from an exquisite gold cane. Instead, there were kirtles carefully sewn from rough linen, warm soup served in chipped wooden bowls, and a lovely nightlight made from scrap glass.\nAs the snow melted into droplets on his coat, Outsider haphazardly wiped them off with a towel and moved to the stove to start preparing dinner. Soon, the enticing aroma of cooking filled the air. Fina closed the half-finished picture book she was drawing in, carefully placing it on her lap to make room for the warm soup Outsider brought over.\nIt was just an ordinary evening — until a harsh knock rattled the old wooden door. Standing outside was a well-dressed gentleman, clutching a familiar gold cane. Upon seeing the cane, Fina's utensils clattered to the floor, along with the picture book and pencils in her lap.\n\"Mr Outsider, I presume?\" The gentleman removed his hat with a polite nod. \"I am Morris Glenville. Thank you for taking care of Serafina, my runaway daughter. I've come to take her home.\"\n\nOutsider turned to see Fina shrinking into a corner, her small form curled up in fear. Her eyes, wide with terror, brimmed with tears. No words needed; Outsider understood what he had to do.\nHe stepped forward, shielding Fina with his body. \"Please leave. She is my sister, not your daughter.\"\n\"Perhaps there's been some misunderstanding, sir,\" Morris replied with a chilling smile, his eyes growing colder. \"Her status isn't for someone of your kind to determine.\" He produced a pistol from his coat, aiming it steadily at Outsider. \"You may have heard of me — I have little patience for pointless negotiations. Rest assured, I mean no harm if you understand your place. In fact, I'm even prepared to offer you a generous reward for your troubles in caring for my daughter these days.\"\nHe then turned to Fina, still cowering in the corner. \"Come now, my dear. Be a good girl — just give Daddy the box your mommy gave you and come home.\"\nNeither Outsider nor Fina responded. Morris's patience began to wear thin. He pressed the gun to Outsider's forehead, raising his voice. \"Don't test my patience. I'm going to count to ten. If you don't cooperate, I'll have to resort to less civil means.\"\n\n\"Ten.\"\nFina's gaze fixed on the pistol. She remembered that stormy night two weeks ago — the very same gun had taken her mother's life. The bullet had been meant for her, but her mother had shielded her from it. She fell to the ground, blood gushing from the wound like a crimson blossom in the rain.\nShe kept saying, \"Run, Fina. Don't look back.\"\n\n\"Nine.\"\nFina looked to Outsider. His hand was hidden behind him, discreetly reaching for the hilt of a dagger, yet trembling slightly. Even Fina, who had rarely left home, had heard from the servants what fate awaited a Charon who dared to harm a Mortalan.\n\"Eight.\"\nFina's mind raced back to that rainy night. She had run with all her might, her stepfather and the servants' footsteps closing in behind her. She had called forth Mr White Bird from her fairy tales, who briefly slowed them down. But just when she gasped for breath, relieved at her escape, her foot slipped, and she tumbled into the icy torrent.\nIn the darkness, she felt the cold water pulling her deeper into an abyss darker than the stormy night. She struggled desperately, grasping at splintered planks that could barely keep her afloat; she also felt rotting vegetables and sharp, slimy fish bones. Eventually, she lost the strength to hold on, letting the current drag her to an unknown fate.\n\n\"Seven.\"\nFina remembered that rainy night. As the water engulfed her, Fina thought to herself, \"Maybe I'm going to join Mommy and Daddy in another world.\" She felt her consciousness, her memories, and her very essence ebbing away. \"Mommy,\" she murmured weakly, \"Mommy.\"\nPerhaps her cry reached the heavens — she thought she heard footsteps halt beside her. Then she felt gentle arms pull her from the cold darkness. It must be Mommy, she thought, and she finally drifted off to sleep.\n\n\"Six.\"\nFina recalled waking in an unfamiliar room. The room was tiny, smaller even than the attic she used to live in; the bed was hard, harder than any servant's bed. But a beam of sunlight had found its way through a crack in the roof. Dust motes danced merrily in the rays before settling on the back of a stranger, yet she wasn't afraid. The image reminded her of her mother — when she was very little and still had a \"home,\" she would always wake up to see her mother's silhouette in the morning light.\n\"Mommy,\" she whispered hoarsely to the figure. \"Mommy...\"\n\n\"Five.\"\nFina remembered the day she called Outsider \"Mommy.\" He had crossed his arms, utterly baffled. \"Don't you mean 'Daddy'...? No, wait, I'm not that old... 'Brother' would be the right title.\"\nBut her mind was in a fog, and she couldn't bring herself to figure out the situation. \"Mommy,\" she kept muttering. Outsider eventually shrugged, resigned. \"Alright, whatever you like.\"\n\n\"Four.\"\nFina's hand discreetly fumbled around her. Since she was severely wounded from falling into the sewer, her faint magic powers hadn't recovered. She groped desperately for anything that might help.\nSuddenly, her fingers brushed against something cold and hard — it was a gun. Outsider's gun.\n\n\"Three.\"\nFina remembered how Outsider was clueless about caring for a child when she first arrived. She missed her mother a lot and was always tearful. Failing to comfort her, Outsider frustratedly raked his hands through his hair. Then, a spark of inspiration struck — he rummaged and retrieved a gun from the cabinet, carefully removing the bullets before handing it to her. \"Here, take this. When I was a kid, this was my favourite toy.\"\nHowever, the sight of the gun — the same kind of metal that had taken her mother's life — only intensified Fina's sobbing.\n\n\"Two.\"\nFina remembered how Outsider fell silent when she tossed the gun away. But eventually, he still picked it up and placed it back in her hands. With a mix of seriousness and tenderness, he told Fina—\n\"Don't fear this thing,\" he instructed softly. \"I'll teach you how to master it. Though it's dangerous, it's the only thing you can rely on to protect yourself and the people you care about.\"\n\n\"One.\"\nFina remembered her little birthday celebration. That day, she wrapped her mother in the wings of her Mr White Bird plush. \n\"Fina will protect Mommy.\"\n\n\"Zero.\"\nThe plush bird's feathers fell like snow, clouding her vision.\n\n\"Bang—\"\nThe gunshot echoed.\nMorris Glenville staggered backwards, his frame hitting the ground with a heavy thud. Disbelief etched his features as he collapsed, a dagger piercing his heart and a bullet hole in his chest.\nThe gun tumbled from Fina's hand, the smoke from the muzzle curling up into the air. She looked towards Outsider, her sweet smile tinged with sadness. \"Outsider, now we're both 'bad sorcerers,' aren't we?\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_18010405": "Fina and Outsider together buried her stepfather and his golden cane beneath a pine tree by Lamenting Lake.\nShe closed her eyes. Once, she had been consumed by deep hatred and fear for the man who had brought so much misfortune into her life. But now, memories of him had melted away like snowflakes caught in her hair, dissolving into distant oblivion.\nHer hair had grown longer, and Outsider had helped to dye her silver locks a beautiful shade of azure, like the waters of Lamenting Lake or the colour of her eyes. This new appearance allowed her to walk among the crowd without being recognised. The name \"Serafina Glenville\" had been carried away by the winds over Icelake, leaving behind only Fina, Outsider's sister. A new chapter of her story was ready to unfold.\n\nOn a clear afternoon, Fina opened a blank notebook, picked up a quill, and carefully wrote down the title of her new story: The Song of the Niveous Nightingale.\nSuddenly, a clattering noise interrupted her thoughts. She set down the pen, intending to ask her brother to be a bit quieter, only to see him approaching with a cardboard box in his hands. \"You might want to go over these,\" Outsider said as he placed the box on the table. \"I forgot to mention — I found this bundle near you in the sewer. Thought it might belong to you.\"\n\"This is...\" Fina gasped as she lifted a small box from the carton. Though caked in mud and dust, the intricate craftsmanship was evident. \"The family heirloom Mommy left to me.\"\n\"Wow, that sounds awesome! Let's see what's inside — maybe it'll turn us into rich folks, so we can buy a bigger house.\" Outsider joked as he wiped away the grime. \"Huh, there's a combination lock on it...\"\n\"Wait!\" Fina suddenly remembered her mother's warning. \"Don't open it! Mommy said it could explode if the wrong password is entered!\"\nShe jumped up, trying to grab the box, but before she could, there was a soft click.\n\"It didn't explode,\" Outsider said, puzzled. \"I just tried a random number and it opened. But there's nothing much inside, just a piece of paper.\" Realising the potential significance of this thing, he immediately handed the box to Fina. \"Maybe you should read it yourself.\"\n\n—What could it be?\n\"Could it be... a treasure map?\" Fina wondered, tilting her head as she unfolded the paper. Suddenly, she choked up, and her hands began to tremble. Outsider leaned over, only to find a thin letter, with just one line of elegant handwriting:\n<H>My dearest child, may you find your own happiness.</>\n\nFina's thoughts drifted back to a night many years ago, when she had been jolted awake by a nightmare. Frantically, she had run downstairs in search of her mother, only to pause outside the bedroom, overhearing a conversation between her mother and stepfather.\n\"Morris, I promised I would give you the treasure in the box someday. But it’s not today — it'll be the day when Serafina comes of age,\" her mother said, her voice calm and resolute. \"In exchange, I'll need your assurance — you must ensure Serafina grows up safe and well.\"",

A small amount of fish was neatly arranged there, and behind it was a small building made of inexpensive bricks. Inside, there was barely any decent furniture except for a cooking pot and an aged wooden bed. The only remaining item was a locked drawer — Tabethe's target.\nA dim light swayed in the fishy breeze.

She turned around and grabbed two fish, then told Tabethe about her mother's illness, the change in the drawer, and how she occasionally saw Tabethe salivating over the fish. Tabethe stared with wide eyes, still taken aback, as the girl stuffed the fish into her hands. The two fish were weighty, and the tighter Tabethe clenched, the more they slipped away from her.\n\"You're giving me these two fish? But do you have anything to eat yourself?\"\n\"I'll be fine.

She guarded it like it was a physical treasure, or a treasured memory.\nAnd one day, the blue dress reappeared. However, it had since turned grey, the colour of contaminated seawater.\n\"Sorry, I have no food for you this time, and in the future. My mum passed away recently.\"\nLooking at the girl's dirty face, Tabethe did not know how to comfort her. Tears washed away the dust, leaving two streaks on her face. Her once bright eyes had gone dim, like the depths of the dark sea. Tabethe's tentacles twisted uneasily, and she patted her pockets up and down, slowly taking out a small piece of carefully-wrapped fish and presenting it to the girl.\n\"You're giving me this fish? Do you have anything to eat yourself?\"\n\"I'll be fine. And I think... you need the fish more than I do.\"\nAs the girl took the fish, tears ran down her face along the streaks.

Filled with awe and curiosity, she reached out and touched the bracer on Lynn's arm. The innocence of the gesture reminded Lynn of her own fearless attitude as a child. She tried to lift the corners of her mouth into a smile, which she was rather unused to. However, this moment was suddenly interrupted by distant shouts. A young woman hurried over and pulled the child away from Lynn. Stepping back a few paces, she bowed repeatedly with a mixture of fear and respect, even cowering and lowering her voice, \"Sorry officer, she doesn't understand. I apologise for any offence. Please forgive her!\"\nThe sudden turn of events left Lynn momentarily stunned as she sized up the woman. From her gaunt, pale contours, a fragment of the past gradually resurfaced in Lynn's memory. This child's mother was none other than a friend she used to play with on the streets.\nThe joy of reuniting after a long separation flickered through Lynn's heart, but the old friend kneeling before her, submissive and trembling, prevented her from uttering any joyful words of reunion. They were within arm's reach, yet Lynn lacked the strength to reach out and help her friend to her feet. In the suffocating silence, Lynn only managed to squeeze out several words of forgiveness.\n\"It's fine...\"\nShe turned away in panic, hearing the woman reprimanding her daughter and the girl crying. The sound felt like countless tiny needles piercing Lynn's heart.",

  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_31020401": "Hilda had a bright and affluent childhood.\nEvery day, she woke up in the embrace of velvet covers, then proceeded to reminisce about the dreams she just had without a care in the world.\nAt breakfast, she carefully removed the crusts from her bread. And in the afternoon, she scraped some cream off her cakes to make them less sweet.\nAt night, she liked to read poetry under the huge chandelier in her drawing room. Whether they were old myths or fashionable love poems, she would read them out loud all the same.\nIn a nutshell, Hilda's life was like a big landscape painting that resembled her sweet smile. \nHowever, she was also aware that her life was much like a canvas, unreal and easy to be shattered with a single poke.\nSome crucial elements were missing from her life, like her parents.\nHer parents were nobles of the Empire and also soldiers of the 4th Legion. But underneath all that, they were agents.\nIn fact, very few nobles were willing to join the 4th Legion. The non-stop gruelling training and the life-risking missions were just secondary concerns. Even more unbearable was that once they become a part of the vast intelligence network, they were deeply entangled within it, becoming a node within an intricate web, making it nearly impossible to break free. They had to bid farewell to a stable life, don collars, and become pawns. Unless they desperately pleaded for promotion at the expense of their freedom, dignity, and lives.\nHilda's father, a fallen minor nobleman, found himself in a contradictory position due to his higher status, yet inability to enjoy the luxuries of high society. This inner conflict compelled him to join the 4th Legion and travel to another nation. Dressed in well-pressed attire each day and holding a cane, he used the guise of a government official to attend feasts of officials and wealthy magnates. There, he would listen into inebriated conversations, discovering valuable information for the Empire amidst the seemingly endless babble.\nJust like other romantic agent stories, during the sixth year of his life abroad, he encountered a red-haired lady. Code-named \"Concerto\", she too belonged to the 4th Legion and was an admired special agent within the Legion.\nNights, trench coats, bullets, perfume, windy rooftops, enemies, goblets of wine, a red ball gown, and vital intel gained after much difficulty.\nAll these romantic elements came together to form a raging fire.\nAnd Hilda was the lingering afterglow of this conflagration — bright, intense, yet lonely. She lived alone in her father's old mansion, meeting her mother once a month. As for her father, Hilda only knew his name and faintly recalled his appearance.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_31020402": "At the age of 12, Hilda finally grasped the uniqueness of her family, and understood why she could only meet her mother on nights of the full moon. When the moonlight bathed everything in its glow, it was challenging for agents to remain concealed. Therefore, it was also a rare moment of respite for those who were accustomed to lurking in the shadows.\nOn days like these, Hilda would close her book of poems, not needing to light up all the lamps in the house to dispel her loneliness. Instead, she would chat with her mother on the balcony. Most of the time, Hilda would talk about the verses she had recently read, while her mother would occasionally share her own observations. Cats being chased by dogs on foreign streets, lovers whispering beneath towering city walls, stories from years past that did not align with what books said, and so on.\nLady Concerto, Hilda's mother, never shared too much about herself. The dangers she had experienced were hard to put into words, and to those who listened, they might even carry a sense of romance. She didn't want to see her daughter treading the same path as her. Although she did not hate her profession, that did not mean she wanted others to go through what she had.\nHowever, her father who was rarely present held a different perspective when he returned from overseas. He believed that Hilda should embrace the shadows just like her parents and become an agent herself. Perhaps, a big part of his motivation was due to his genuine loyalty to the Empire, but more importantly, it stemmed from the fact that Hilda, being born into such a family, could hardly have a normal life. Even if she did not join the Legion, they would still find ways to recruit her.\nOnce her parents' difference in opinion arose, her life became like a cracked canvas. Fragile and difficult to mend.\nOn the day Hilda saw her father for the second time, she heard an enormous argument between her parents. It was so loud it sounded like the walls of the house were breaking down. The clash between the two agents suddenly shifted from a verbal argument to a living room-scale conflict that could easily draw the attention of nearby Legion soldiers.\nAt this moment, Hilda made a decision. She became determined to mend her abnormal family, and within her heart, the seed of adventure bloomed to life. She wanted to see her parents more often and in more places, and speak to them more often. She even fantasised about carrying out covert missions in the shadows alongside her parents, with the only bright things before her being the gleaming of blades and their concerned eyes.\nTherefore, on one snowy night at the age of 15, Hilda bid farewell to her poems and her bright home, and knocked on the door which led to a dark place. This was a runaway plan with a clear goal. Hilda started to learn about the things that her mother mentioned in their daily talks: guns, ammunition, and weapons...\nIn the end, she officially joined the 4th Legion, becoming a thorn among flowers, poison within honey, and a shadow under the moon, just like her mother.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_31020403": "Hilda could no longer recall the details of her encounter with Flora before. Her mind was filled with more important matters. This was her first mission, and the name of the target was Flora. She was the daughter of a noble whose status was so eminent that it was difficult to put into words. Her mission was to disguise herself as a maid, closely follow this nobleman's daughter, ensure her safety, and await further instructions.\nHilda repeated her mission guidelines in her head, feeling both curious and slightly nervous. She passed through three heavy doors and finally set eyes on her target surrounded by a vast expanse of flowers. She appeared to be of a similar age to her.\nAt that moment, Hilda, who had considered herself a qualified agent, suddenly felt a hint of panic. Whether it was the unchanged indifference in Flora's eyes upon seeing her, or the dazzling courtyard adorned with gilded decorations and high walls, everything completely overwhelmed her.\nAs the important people who escorted Hilda there departed and the doors slammed shut behind them, the two of them were left alone in the courtyard. Flora, who had remained silent the whole time, slowly broke into a smile. Later, Hilda came to realise that she was the first person of her age that Flora had ever met. Perhaps this was why the rarely expressive noble lady finally smiled after such a long time.\nFrom then on, the two of them lived like a typical mistress and servant in a courtyard that resembled a golden birdcage, enjoying a comfortable life together. They laughed, played, and tended to flowers every day. And on every moonless night, she would don her old agent attire and report on her findings.\nOccasionally, Hilda would feel guilty about betraying Flora's trust, but the thought that her behaviour was driven by the need to protect Flora drove her to continue these covert operations, despite her self-loathing.\nOutside the golden birdcage, Hilda's family had not undergone any fundamental changes. During her training, she had heard countless rumours about Lady Concerto, but she had never encountered her mother within the ranks of the Legion. As for her father, she heard no information about him whatsoever. Given his status, she could not work out whether he had gone on even more secretive missions or if he had met an unfortunate end far from home.\nOne day, Hilda returned home on the night of a full moon and waited for her mother, who always brought her a bouquet of flowers, cold desserts, and endless urging for Hilda to leave the Legion. After Hilda became Flora's maid, Lady Concerto behaved more like an ordinary mother, repeatedly persuading Hilda to leave the Legion and live a normal life. Despite both mother and daughter being aware that the 4th Legion was far from a nobleman's ball, a graceful exit could be achieved with proper etiquette. However, now they could only dance alone, apart from each other, and never coming to a stop.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_31020404": "During a rare visit back home, Hilda caught a glimpse of a handwritten dossier on her mother's desk. It was the first time she had seen her own mother referred to as Lady Concerto. In that moment, Hilda came face to face with a side of her mother she had never known. Within the palace's most extreme circles of power, certain forces had gained the support of the deputy chief of the 4th Legion. Their intention was to eliminate destabilising individuals within the Empire, and the most crucial element of this plan was to eliminate Flora. And the one assigned to carry out this task was none other than Lady Concerto herself.\nThis was not surprising. Lady Concerto was a legend in the Legion. She never failed a mission. However, as Hilda continued reading, she was pained by the content she saw. \n\"The target's guardian, Hilda, is an exceptional agent. If she can be persuaded, it should be enough to ensure the success of this mission. However, Hilda is highly emotional. If she insists on protecting Flora and refuses to cooperate, necessary measures will be taken to ensure the mission is completed.\"\nClutching the thin document, Hilda's hands trembled uncontrollably. She was now on the brink of becoming a trapped fly in a spider's web. Her mother, who had just been laughing with her jovially, in fact had a heartless plan. Her mother's constant urging to leave the Legion was now the last vestige of warmth she had received from her. Now, she had to make a decision.\nOn the other end of this nightmare was her mistress, her friend, perhaps even someone she could call family—Flora.\nHilda did not know what to do. After hastily bidding farewell to her mother, who no longer urged her to leave the Legion and seemed to be determined on something, she returned to the golden courtyard. She could no longer conceal the endless sorrow beneath her smiling facade, and Flora instantly noticed this.\nFlora, having sensed something unusual, asked Hilda if she had received any orders regarding herself.\nConfronted with Hilda's evident shock, Flora began to explain. Within the confines of the golden birdcage, everything was deliberately orchestrated. How could Hilda truly be just a maid? Over the countless days they had spent together, Hilda had become the only thing she could trust in this world of fraud and deceit.\nFlora held Hilda's hand and gave her a warm embrace, placing the heaviest weight on the scale of Hilda's wavering heart.\nLater they discussed things in the sea of flowers for three days and nights. Finally, they decided to seize the opportunity and leave the cage of flowers forever.\nOn one morning when Hilda was allowed to leave, the doors that both protected and confined Flora swung open. Concealed beneath a veil of fine mist, Hilda departed with a delicate figure by her side. And as the agents who guarded the courtyard's perimeter discovered Flora's disappearance, seven marketplaces across the Imperial Capital simultaneously witnessed the appearance of splendidly dressed girls. They all sang the same folk song amidst the bustling markets, each girl's appearance perfectly matching Flora's. Even the Lady Concerto could not discern which one was the real Flora.\nFor a moment, the citizens of the Imperial Capital and the agents alike were thrown into chaos. Amidst the clamour, the disguised mistress and servant quietly moved in the opposite direction of the gathering crowd. Following the route Hilda had planned, they departed from the city, leaving behind the urban landscape bathed in the crimson hues of the newly risen sun.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_31020405": "Hilda could no longer remember her mother's face, and her father was nothing more than a vague, pale silhouette.\nHowever, she did remember some of the legendary tales she had heard about Lady Concerto after joining the Legion. The common folk hardly ever heard her name, but whenever there was an inexplicable explosion, an assassination, or turmoil anywhere, members of the 4th Legion instinctively knew that Lady Concerto had succeeded in another mission.\nHilda found it difficult to connect these deeds with her own mother, which was why she still retained those memories.\nIn her earlier memories, carefully pruned like flower branches, only the finest fragments remained. Such as the moment she first saw her father when she was 10, or when she learned a word that meant sweetness but also meant peculiar. There was also the time she finished reading the poetry collection her mother had brought her. Her mother was forever patient with a gentle smile on her face, and would occasionally respond in kind.\nHowever, at the core of Hilda's heart, there remained an image of her mother that was strikingly clear.\nThat image was from the night when her father returned for the second time and had a big argument with her mother. It was unclear whether it was due to not seeing her mother's face for a long time or the moonlight not being bright enough, but on that night, Hilda suddenly noticed that her mother's face had gained a few more wrinkles, much like the not-so-fresh flowers she brought back. As she looked at her mother's troubled expression, Hilda began to contemplate the possibility of a different path in life.\nThat path might be filled with thorns, but it could also mean releasing the invisible chains that bound her to her mother.\nAnd so, Hilda made up her mind and plunged into the shadows. Contrary to her wishes, her interactions with her mother not only decreased but even the past memories of their time together became difficult to recreate. After that, there were no more poems or songs, only advice and dissatisfaction.\nAnd so, when that crucial document appeared before her, the image of her mother in Hilda's heart crumbled into dust, much like a dried flower.\nAfter that, Hilda never saw her mother again. She only heard that she had faltered in a crucial mission and was no longer the admired agent she once was within the Legion. She was demoted to another nation, and very few people saw her again.\nOn occasion, she would ponder whether the once undefeated Lady Concerto had left that crucial plan out of negligence or if she had done it on purpose. However, she did not want to know the answer to this question. Just as she was no longer curious about where her father and mother might be, who they might have met, and how they might be living their lives.",

His artistic skills were limited — the best he could manage was a ball, or rather, a somewhat misshapen circle.

Scattered across the table were black mechanical parts.\nYale's memories invariably began with the cold, clipped directive from the man in the white lab coat: \"Assemble them.\" This was always followed by Yale's blank stare as he fumbled with the components, and ended with the sound of the door slamming shut in the man's disappointment. \nYale had no idea how many times this sequence had replayed in his mind, nor could he measure the amount of time that had elapsed. In this realm of perpetual monotony, the concept of time was reduced to an insignificant abstraction.\nDuring these endless moments, Yale occasionally entertained the notion that perhaps the entire world was an illusion, a construct inhabited solely by himself and the man in white. Within the confines of his mind, he couldn't recall the sound of anyone else's voice.\nThat changed the day a strange voice pierced the silence, setting the stagnant time into motion once more.\nHe vividly remembered the first word that broke through the silence, delivered in a sharp, disdainful tone—\n\"Knock-off.\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_31030402": "\"Knock-off.\"\nYale vividly remembered the first time he heard that voice — it felt like a pebble suddenly tossed into a serene lake, sending ripples through his mind. He jolted awake, only to find himself staring at the same sterile white walls.\nThe man in the white lab coat appeared once more, carrying the familiar black components, his voice as aloof as ever: \"Assemble them.\" It was the same command Yale had heard countless times in his recurring memories.\nYale picked up the parts, turning them over in his hands. But this time, something was different — he no longer felt lost. It was as if his hands had a memory of their own. The intricate parts fit together as effortlessly as children's building blocks, each piece snapping perfectly into place, as if Yale had always known their proper arrangement.\nAs the final piece clicked into place, like a key turning in a lock, Yale stared in disbelief at the small black object he had created. Across from him, the man in white dropped his pen in astonishment. For the first time, his usually indifferent eyes gleamed with a frenzied joy, like a ravenous vulture spotting a dying lamb. He embraced Yale tightly, repeatedly murmuring, \"Wonderful. You did it. Absolutely wonderful.\"\nFinally, Yale mustered the courage to ask the question that had been burning inside him: \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am a researcher,\" the man replied. \"You can call me Mr Jones.\"\n\"Mr Jones, researcher,\" Yale repeated the words soundlessly to himself, trying to let them sink in. After a moment, he asked another question, \"Who am I?\"\n\"You are Yale,\" Mr Jones responded. \"You are my creation.\"\nYale nodded, then shook his head in bewilderment. At that time, he had no understanding of what it truly meant to be a \"creation.\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_31030403": "Before Yale knew Oliver's name, their relationship was fraught with tension.\nOn one hand, the occasional voice that emerged in his mind had been quite unfriendly — even a child as isolated as Yale couldn't bring himself to befriend the speaker. Actually, to describe it merely as \"unfriendly\" would be an understatement — the voice not only routinely berated him as a \"knock-off\" but also interspersed its harangues with cruel and jarring curses, as if Yale had committed unforgivable sins that even the Misty Sea could not cleanse. Frustrated and feeling wronged by the baseless accusations, Yale often tried to retort. But hampered by his stutter, he would only manage to stammer an ineffectual \"Y—Y—You...\" This, unsurprisingly, only fueled more ruthless mockery from Oliver.\nYet what truly intensified the hostility between them was Mr Jones's reaction when he discovered the existence of this voice. The normally stern man would descend into an unusual frenzy, clutching at Yale's delicate shoulders, his fingers trembling as they dug painfully into the boy's flesh.\n\"You've heard his voice, haven't you!? Tell me you heard it! You must not lose to him, my dear boy, my precious creation. You need to control it, conquer it, and kill it! Do you hear me? Answer me! Now!!!\"\nMr Jones's face twisted with obsession, his forehead pressing against Yale's, spittle flying onto the boy's face. It was a profoundly unsettling experience. Only later, when the assistant researcher explained different emotions to Yale, did he vaguely understand that what he felt was fear — a deep, pervasive fear. Confused, Yale couldn't fathom why Mr Jones reacted so violently and eventually attributed it to the strange voice in his head.\nTheir strained relationship persisted for a long time, until one day, the assistant researcher brought a record player into Yale's room.The record player brought a touch of colour into Yale's otherwise black-and-white world, and for that, he cherished it deeply. Every night, he would look forward to discovering which record would be placed in the machine and what melodies would emerge to fill the room. Conversely, Oliver harboured a strong dislike for the record player, or more precisely, for the persistent static noise it emitted — a noise that made him even more agitated and uneasy. Realising this, a strange thought crossed Yale's mind — perhaps the voice in his head feared that static noise. Yale understood what it felt like to fear something — it was a terrible feeling that made one want to desperately run away. So, the next time the assistant researcher came with a new record, Yale stopped her from playing it.\n\"Don't you like this record anymore?\"\n\"I do, I really do, but I... I just don't want to hear it anymore.\"\nIncapable of lying, Yale couldn't explain his abrupt change of heart to the assistant researcher. Ultimately, she acquiesced and took the record away.\nThat night, Yale found it harder to drift off to sleep without the calming influence of music. Half-asleep, he heard a strange yet familiar humming. The sound was soft and melodious, like a gentle, soothing lullaby for a newborn baby.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_31030404": "Yale never attempted to escape the black straps that bound him to the operating table. He couldn't understand why they felt the need to bind him so tightly — he had no intention of resisting.\nThe floor was littered with dozens of documents stamped \"Confidential\" in bold red. When Researcher Jones noticed that Yale had read these documents, his demeanour once again turned frenzied. He roughly secured the young boy to the operating table and administered an experimental catalyst that wasn't scheduled for use until several months later in the final stage of the experiment.\n\"You naughty rascal, you've seen what you shouldn't have — now I want you to kill him! Do it!\"\nA sensation akin to magma flowing through his veins overwhelmed Yale, triggering an excruciating pain that elicited a piercing scream from the usually soft-spoken boy.\n\n\"Oi, knock-off.\"\nThe familiar yet foreign voice intruded into his thoughts. Yale abruptly opened his eyes, not to the sight of the operating table, but to a gaze as calm as his own — it was another boy who looked exactly like him. Beneath them surged a sea of magma, as red as blood.\n\"Who are you?\"\nThe other did not respond but instead grasped Yale's throat decisively. His inhuman strength made it impossible for Yale to breathe, forcing him into a futile struggle for air. Only then did the owner of the hands speak, his tone slow and laden with contempt:\n\"I'm Oliver... the rightful owner of this body. You're just a knock-off version of me — don't play dumb, you already know all about it.\"\nYale gazed blankly into Oliver's eyes, recalling the confidential file titled \"Controlled Alter Personality Experiment Log.\" The documents detailed the entire experimental procedure, filled with data on the dangerous preliminary personality tests, each page inscribed with the name \"Oliver.\"\nOn the final page, Yale's name abruptly appeared, signifying the successful completion of the personality replacement experiment.\n\"—Yale, I will make you my perfect creation.\"\nSo this was the true meaning of \"creation.\" Precious memories of a happy childhood, life outside the lab, and a loving family — all of these were blank in Yale's mind, not due to forgetfulness, but because they had never existed.\nSo, who was he, really? He was Yale. And who was Yale? Oh, that's right — Yale was nothing more than a coward, a pitiful creature always obedient to the researcher's commands, an imperfect creation, and a parasite who stole a nest that wasn't his.\nOnly this time, Yale decided to help the poor little bird in that stolen nest. He let go of Oliver's hand, ready to surrender himself to the magma and embrace the fiery demise awaiting him.\nHowever, the anticipated suffocation did not follow. Instead, Yale was abruptly hoisted up. As Oliver's curses filled the air, it felt as though countless bombs were detonating around them, the intense ringing in his ears akin to bullets tearing through, churning his brain into chaos.\nAll the anger, the fear, the hatred — they erupted in that explosive moment, only to be silenced by a final, resounding boom.\nYale looked up at Oliver, whose expression remained as hostile as ever, yet Yale sensed that something had subtly shifted; though outwardly, everything appeared unchanged.\n\"Hey, knock-off, there's actually a way for both of us to make it out alive. Are you in?\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_31030405": "The searing pain snapped Yale back to reality. At some point, the restraints that had bound him to the operating table had been undone. Lifting his head slowly, Yale locked eyes with Jones, whose bloodshot eyes were filled with incredulous glee.\nFor the first time, Yale, who had never lied, had to deceive Jones.\nHe inched closer to the researcher, each step a monumental effort. With every pause, tears silently slipped down his cheeks, tracing a miniature galaxy in the dark confines of the lab.\nJones seemed to be smiling, likely thinking Yale was crying over Oliver's death. He was convinced that this timid subject was, after all, an obedient child, a perfect creation that would never defy orders.\nOnly Yale knew the real reason for his tears. For the first time, he willingly embraced Jones — the once formidable man no longer seemed frightening at all.\n\"I've killed Oliver.\"\nYale's sobs grew more intense as he clung to Jones, crying uncontrollably in his arms. He even felt Jones gently pat his head, a rare gesture, almost like the father Yale had always wished for.\nYet, this was all inauthentic. Despite the warmth of Jones's touch, it came from a pair of hands that had orchestrated countless experiments that tormented him and Oliver and ruined their lives. It was time to bid farewell to these hands.\nYale pulled out the device he had been assembling every day — the one Oliver had dubbed the micro-bomb. All he had to do was press it against Jones, and in the ensuing chaos of the fire, he could escape to the vast world outside this white prison.\n\"Do it, Yale. It's okay if you want to cry for this man's death later.\"\nThe alchemy lab was ablaze, flames voraciously spreading, painting the night sky a vivid, grotesque red, erasing all traces of the sterile white.\nYale ran with every ounce of strength he had, his spirit soaring as he and Oliver alternated control of their body, gulping down the air outside that white prison. The air, thick with smoke, was acrid yet oddly sweet. Yale understood it was the scent of \"fire.\" No one could stop them now. They left Jones behind, left the lab behind, and left the Alchemy Academy behind.\nFinally, Yale collapsed, utterly spent, but the overwhelming sights around him kept his eyes wide open. The liberating breeze tempted him to struggle to his feet, even though he had no strength left.\nAs consciousness began to fade, Yale heard Oliver's voice once more, but this time it was calm, a tone he had never heard before. Oliver, taking off and tossing away the nameplate on Yale's chest, declared:\n\"From now on, Yale is no longer anyone's creation.\"",

As a child, she couldn't understand why such relentless persecution persisted — why pain and hardship, meant to be avoided, were wielded as instruments of power. In Icelake, the privileged often demonstrated their status by inflicting misery on others, a practice Margie found utterly senseless.\nDuring that time, Icelake seemed to Margie to be shrouded in a strange, purplish haze — a hue that reminded her of the numbing cold of frostbite.",

If you miss out on such a lovely season due to relentless work, you'll heartbreakingly regret it once the long winter sets in.\nSo, Margie easily convinced herself that taking a rare break wouldn't hurt. Instead of bustling about as usual, she chose to lounge lazily on a bench, soaking up the warm spring sunshine.\nAs she drifted towards sleep, a conversation about a stray cat caught her ear.\n\"Look, Mom, it's licking my hand! It's so sad this little kitty doesn't have a home. Can we take it home?\"\n\"Sweetheart, I can let you take this one home. But you know, there are so many stray cats and dogs out there. We can't possibly take care of them all, right? So, it can only happen once. Are you sure you want to take this one home?\"\nThe dialogue tapered off, not because their conversation ended, but because Margie finally dozed off, torn between guilt and the rare pleasure of lazing around.\n\nWhen she woke, the sun had nearly vanished behind the city walls. Just as she was about to rub her bleary eyes, she felt something furry resting on her hand.\nShe glanced down to see a tiny black kitten curled up beside her, blending into the night as the sun set, probably seeking warmth from her. Lifting the kitten gently, Margie chuckled at its peculiar appearance — a skinny little thing with long white eyebrows that made it look like a quirky old man, which was probably why the mother and child hadn't taken it home.\nWrapping the kitten in her coat, Margie walked through the slum, bathed in the glow of streetlights. She smiled and responded to greetings from the residents as she made her way back to her humble home. Cuddling the kitten in her arms, she smiled and murmured, \"Everyone needs a bit of care now and then, whether it's a Mortalan, a Charon, or a kitten like you.\"\nThe kitten, looking simultaneously old and young, didn't understand her words but timidly accepted her caress, retracting its tiny claws.\nAfter pondering for a moment, Margie playfully grabbed the kitten's flicking tail and kneaded it, giggling, \"From now on, you're Blacktail... Ow!\"\nThe next day, with three fresh scratches on her face, Margie resumed her tasks with a heavy heart. Even the warmth of Icelake's sun failed to lift her spirits. But everyone knew that by lunchtime, the cheerful Margie would return to brighten their day.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_33010402": "Margie's day begins with her helmet securely fastened on her head.\nShe then whips out her trusty map and notebook, cross-referencing her knowledge of each rubbish bin with the whispers and observations she gathered the previous day to plan her route. Slinging a shovel over her shoulder and lugging a hessian sack, she sets off with a spring in her step, eager to discover what treasures the day holds.\nAs she hums along, passing by street corners, Aunt Sarah, who is usually busy with her laundry, waves with her red, frostbitten hand. Uncle Rett, the local carpenter, playfully scatters sawdust in the air like confetti as Margie passes, which always makes the florist's daughter across the street giggle at the sight...\nThis is Margie's daily routine, a rhythm of life she dearly loves. She always greets everyone she meets with a radiant smile.\nHowever, there's one exception — when the carpenter's daughter, Kennice, mockingly curtsies and exclaims with a raised pitch, \"Good day, your highness! May the god of dustbins forever bless you, our beloved princess!\" Before Kennice can finish, she dashes off, spurred by the laughter of nearby adults, as Margie, once beaming, now sports a scowl and brandishes her sack as if ready to scoop up Kennice along with the day's refuse.\nRather than revel in the \"Princess\" moniker she inherited from her father, known as the \"King of the Bins,\" Margie prefers her self-appointed title — \"Lady Margie the reticent detective, a lone shadow-walker of the city.\"\nPerhaps Kennice's \"prayer\" truly worked, for today Margie's finds are especially abundant: velvet curtains discarded by a noble, a nearly two-metre-tall bookshelf, and even a few silver coins forgotten in an old backpack's secret pocket. Furthermore, today's extraordinary finds include letters faintly scented with disinfectant and pages filled with complex equations, discovered in a rubbish bin outside a big house.\nThe detective in Margie perked up immediately. Her instincts told her that the owner of these items was no ordinary person. Though the complex formulas were beyond her understanding, the unsigned, unaddressed letters might just reveal untold secrets.\nWith a racing heart, Margie read through each letter:\n\n\"My dear daughter, if you're still alive, the sound of your laughter would truly fill this house instead of being just an echo in my ears...\"\n\"It's not the notions of right or wrong that haunt me, but the irreversible nature of loss...\"\n\"I turned away that girl's parents. I can't bear the thought of reliving that nightmare. I've decided to cease my research. Hayley, would you support my decision if you were here?\"\n\"I hope I never live to regret this...\"\nThe letters bore no signature, but Margie could already piece together the image of a reclusive doctor and the shadows of his past.\nRubbish bins hold more than just discarded items — they're a trove of stories and secrets, telling tales of sorrow and joy that reflect the myriad struggles and resilience of numerous lives. And yet, in this vast, confining city, people still strive to find a way to live on.\n\nAs night fell, Margie concluded her day's work, enriched with new finds, and began her journey home.\nKennice, the carpenter's daughter, was already waiting at the corner, clutching a small flower. Awkwardly, she apologised, \"I'm sorry for calling you that name. I know you don't like it...\"\nMargie glanced up to see the florist's daughter through the window, watering plants, giving her a conspiratorial wink.\nWith a knowing smile, Margie patted Kennice on the shoulder, \"Don't worry about it! After all, I was the one who didn't keep my promise to bring you a gift. But hey, let's blame the Rubbish Bin God for not smiling on me yesterday.\"\nShe then magically produced a cleaned-up old backpack from her sack, \"Thanks to your prayer, I had great luck today! Here, this is the gift I promised you.\" She took the small orange flower from Kennice, \"And I accept your apology! Now, we're good, huh?\"\n\"Absolutely!\" Kennice beamed, curtsying to Margie again, \"Thank you, Miss Reticent Detective!\"\n",

Even among the resilient Charons, few could cross the frozen expanse with a young child in tow.\nWhen the father and daughter finally reached Icelake, bringing an end to months of gruelling nomadic hardship, Martin was surprised and delighted to find that Margie had grown two centimetres taller than when they'd first set out. At that moment, tears welled up in his eyes.\nLittle Margie couldn't understand why her father, who had just excitedly measured her height moments before, suddenly bowed his head. No matter how much she teased him by calling him \"silly old man,\" he wouldn't lift his gaze. Puzzled, she absent-mindedly brushed the lingering snow off his shoulder, only to notice with surprise that her usually playful, giddy father had begun to sprout a few strands of grey hair that no amount of brushing could remove.",

To her, the world had consisted solely of endless snowfields, extreme cold, predators and prey, starry skies, and the lonely warmth of a campfire shared with her father — her only companion.\nBut then Icelake, the destination her father had spoken of, abruptly appeared before her. At that moment, she could only describe her impression of the city in the simplest of terms: \"Wow! What a big camp! So many people! So many new smells!\"\nMargie felt like a lost child who had finally found her tribe. She was neither scared nor nervous. Instead, an overwhelming sense of belonging took root in her heart — she realised, for the first time, that the world wasn't just her and her father. And when night fell, the city's transformation was nothing short of breathtaking for Margie. If a single campfire at night had once sufficed to warm her, the myriad lights twinkling from the city's windows would now surely bathe her in an unimaginable glow of warmth.\nSo, when her father asked if she wanted to live there, she nodded without hesitation. Shortly thereafter, a woman named Camilla provided a long list of \"dos & don'ts and off-limit places within Icelake\", which overwhelmed young Margie into drowsiness. When she was awakened by Camilla for the fourth time, she finally blurted her confusion out, \"There weren't this many rules living on the snowfields! Is it more dangerous here than in the wild?\"\nCamilla and her father fell into a long, silent pause. Just as Margie was about to doze off again, her father gently patted her head and murmured, \"Sweetie, perhaps you're right.\"\n\nThe second time Margie stood at the gates of Icelake, she was leaving. The towering city she once marvelled at had transformed in her eyes — it now resembled a silent, hulking beast, its gates a gaping maw. The joy and excitement of her initial visit had dissipated, replaced by a mix of confusion and disillusionment.\nShe couldn't understand why being impervious to the cold and having horns was enough to make her a target of scorn. She didn't understand why sneaking into the \"inner city\" out of curiosity could warrant harsh punishment. Most terrifyingly, everyone else seemed to accept this as normal — even the Mortalan children would unhesitatingly throw stones at her, as if she were an outright monster. It was then that Margie realised, belatedly, that what she had thought was her haven had never truly welcomed her.\nPerhaps a child born of the snowfields is destined to return to the endless white.\nTurning back, fighting the tears that threatened to fall, she embarked on a solitary adventure.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_33010405": "Cold, perpetually cold.\nMargie didn't need to open her eyes to see the endless expanse of white stretching out before her once more, seemingly inescapable as the days and months passed — as if they were forever ensnared in its grasp.\nThe young Margie, still fuming over her disillusionment with Icelake, chose to trek deeper into the snowy wilderness, away from the city steeped in inequity. The deeper she ventured, the more her mind replayed scenes from her previous journey with her father—\n\nAs they first stepped onto the icy terrain, young Margie would ask her father daily, \"Are we there yet?\"\nEach time, Martin would respond with a number. Though young Margie lacked a tangible grasp of \"distance,\" she understood that once the number dwindled to zero, their gruelling trek would conclude.\nBut the number didn't always diminish. When they got lost in the snow and ended up circling back to their previous campsite, the number went up. Injuries would also slow their progress, and when the harsh clime finally overcame Margie, rendering her too sick to stand, that number froze, just like everything else around them.\nDays of fever turned Margie into a small ember of heat in a vast, freezing wilderness. In her delirium, dreams of summer and sunlight had long since faded, replaced by the relentless cold. Yet, during her moments of lucidity, she still whispered the same question, her voice growing fainter each time: \"Are we there yet?\"\nBut there was no answer — only silence and her father's trembling hand, brushing gently over her burning forehead.\nDuring one particularly cold night, Margie dreamt of a star falling into her arms. Despite being dimmed by its descent, it still burned fiercely against her chill.\nThe next morning, as sunlight bathed her face, the fever had left her, and she felt surprisingly light and warm, almost as if she were still dreaming. Her father's crushing embrace and something warm and fluffy nestled in her arms confirmed the miracle — she had fully recovered.\nThe critter nestled in her arms would later become the inspiration for Plumpytail, the plush toy she would always carry with her. But back then, she was a scrawny little wildling, likely separated from her kin, her thin fur ill-equipped for the frost. Desperate for warmth, she had snuggled close to the only source of heat she could find — Margie's fevered body.\nIn the days that followed, their duo was joined by this little creature, cautious yet curious. She kept a watchful distance, only approaching when Margie laid out the best strips of jerky and stepped back. After vigorously sniffing the air, as if trying to make out all the odours, she would timidly snatch the offering...\n\nA piercing birdcall snapped Margie back to reality, reminding her that she now trod a path opposite to the one she had taken with her father. She sighed, trying to figure out the travel distance for a number to count again, but she had no idea where to begin.\nWhere was she supposed to go? Margie didn't know. Old Martin's homeland wasn't home, and neither was Icelake — so where did she belong? Was it this endless expanse of snow?\nThe snow continued to fall, like confetti from the nobles' parades, settling softly on Margie's shoulders.\nShe lost track of time. The snow thickened, and her vision faded. She felt as if wrapped in a silvery blanket, the wind's lullaby coaxing her into the downy embrace of the snow beneath her.\nAmidst this familiar chill, Margie's dreams were unexpectedly vibrant. She dreamed of laughter and melodies, of people whose faces bore no trace of the hardship they knew too well. They called her \"Princess,\" \"Sweetie,\" or \"Little Detective.\" She saw Camilla, Kennice, and the florist's daughter — everyone had healthy, rosy cheeks, untouched by the biting wind and snow.\nAnd at the very end, she saw Plumpytail — the little wildling she hadn't seen since leaving the snowfields. She had grown so much since then.\nNo, this was not a dream — Margie suddenly woke from her delirium. Plumpytail was real, because she appeared different from the little scrawny critter in her memories. She had become more nimble, hunting small creatures on the snowfields, even leaving a portion for Margie, who was still weak. Even the scraps she left behind after finishing a meal attracted plump birds, keeping them fed.\nMargie's heart eased. Plumpytail had found her way as a predator, able not only to feed herself but also to sustain the weaker creatures of the snowfields. Most importantly, she had found her own way of living.\n\nMargie remembered the dream she had, in which all the gaunt faces in the slums suddenly became healthy and cheerful. It was only a dream, but she suddenly realised what she had to do.\n\"Old Martin! I'm coming back!\" she shouted into the wind, turning towards the direction from which she had come. \"From today on, I'm going to scour every rubbish bin in Icelake with you!\"\n\"Goodbye, Plumpytail!\" she waved to the cat in the snow, then set off once more towards Icelake, a vast city filled with inequalities, but at the same time brimming with hopes and possibilities.",

Before settling into his camp bed, Randy meticulously follows a precise routine: slipping on a silk sleep mask, lighting soothing sleep incense, and only then, with great reverence, does he allow himself to lie down. If anyone dares ask him about work during this sacred time, he'll quickly brush them off with an array of excuses: \"I stayed up late working last night,\" \"Some things just can't be rushed,\" \"The stars advise against working today,\" or \"Only those who appreciate the virtues of rest can achieve great things.\"\nIf you go along with his excuses, you'll likely find that Randy has already finished his tasks well before starting his elaborate bedtime ritual.

It's not that Randy is emotionally tone-deaf — he simply can't fathom the fervour and fanaticism soldiers feel for that kind of devotion. It baffles him, much like how he never understood why his father would reduce himself to a mindless instrument of war just for an abstract notion of honour propagated in the oath, ultimately paying the price with his life, left in a vegetative state.​",

He realised that for humanity, there's no such thing as an \"ultimate weapon\" — there's always a stronger one on the horizon.

It took two canisters of tear gas for him to retrieve the lady's empty handbag. It was only then that Randy realised the entire ordeal was a well-crafted ruse, disguised by the lady's charming smile.\nEvery time he receives a thank-you card from the lady, expressing gratitude for handling her \"pursuer,\" Randy can't help but recall that bizarre encounter.

He resorted to using a mini noise radar to track their movements and set booby traps with ropes in his bedroom to fend off his ever-vibrant eldest sister. But after narrowly escaping her clutches, he soon found himself at the mercy of his smiling, poised second sister, who played him like a fiddle until he conceded defeat. As punishment, he had to try on new dresses for his sisters and pose for pictures, which were then framed and proudly hung in the family's main hall for all to see.\nThankfully, the photo's display was short-lived.

But as he stood amidst the disciplined ranks of Hyperborean soldiers, terror gripped him — a force that seemed to pull him in, seeking to bind him to the armoured tanks, artillery, and hulking airships surrounding him. It was as though the machinery was trying to absorb him into its cold, unfeeling core.\nIn that moment, Randy understood what his horns and inherited magic powers truly meant. They weren't for decoration or pulling off party tricks. They were a cruel curse, a mark of damnation placed on him from birth. Though his stern father had pushed him through gruelling combat training, he had also shielded him from the Empire's darkest truths.\nThe gleaming medals his father had once cherished suddenly made sense to him — they were mere bones tossed to sheepdogs by wolves. Scraps that spared the dogs from the predators' jaws and occasionally gave them the illusion of power.\nRandy now grasped the full weight of his father's insistence on training him. He was meant to take up the mantle, to uphold the Howard name — the model family of Laurel Charons. To protect everything that came with that title: a comfortable life, dignity, his sisters' carefree laughter, and, ultimately, survival itself.\nTo preserve those things, Randy would have to become part of the Hyperborean war machine, just another cog in the empire's iron will.

She fights alongside her troops in the heat of battle, personally bandaging their wounds, and delivers rousing speeches amidst the rising chants of \"Chief Sibylle.\" These acts not only bolster morale but also solidify her legendary status. Sibylle is well aware of this and wields such theatrics as yet another weapon in her tactical arsenal.\nYet, it remains uncertain whether these actions are purely calculated or driven by genuine emotion.

Others, like Sibylle Mason, have earned their place through sheer military prowess — wielding influence not only on the battlefield but also within the Empire's political landscape.\nSibylle's meteoric rise from an ordinary legion chief to her current exalted position is mostly a result of her exceptional military achievements. Her combat strategies are more agile and inventive than those of any chief the Empire has seen before.\nAccording to the Empire's time-honoured traditions, a soldier's greatest glory is earned in direct confrontation: troops march forward with unwavering courage and iron discipline, undaunted even as they close in on the enemy. Chiefs, however, are expected to oversee the battlefield with a sharp, predatory gaze, bearing the burden of the rising death toll, waiting for the perfect moment to make a decisive move — a bloody gamble where soldiers' lives are the stakes and fate itself is the dealer.\nGlory, pure and undeniable, is the dream of every chief — a single, monumental victory that would immortalize their name. To have a warship, a street, or even a city bear your name was the ultimate prize.\nBut in the face of the rebellion by The Forsakens, such lofty aspirations became little more than a pipe dream. These insurgents, relying on \"Daimons\" as their main force, rarely engaged the Legion head-on. Instead, they used magic and superior mobility to wage guerrilla warfare, striking from the shadows with hit-and-run attacks. They even weaponized Filthoids to devastating effect. The Legion's traditional combat methods proved futile, and those chiefs who clung to their notions of glory were left swallowing the bitter draught of defeat.\nSibylle, however, was not one of them. Born on the streets, with deep knowledge of alchemy and Charon magic, she knew exactly how to counter these elusive foes.\nShe requisitioned as much grain as possible, starving the rebels of their supplies.\nShe sent Charon citizens as false defectors, infiltrating The Forsakens and poisoning their rations before ordering surprise attacks.\nShe staged strategic retreats, leaving behind booby-trapped supplies, spreading terror throughout enemy ranks.\nShe offered noble titles to enemy leaders in exchange for their allegiance, only to slaughter them all once victory was assured.\n...\nThis is how Sibylle claimed victory after victory, battlefield after battlefield. Her Charon heritage never hindered her rise.\nThough her methods were often criticized as dishonourable — \"What else would you expect from someone of such lowly birth?\" her detractors sneered — none could deny the truth: Sibylle is the Empire's most reliable legion chief.

She would fold her legs into specially designed trousers, posing as a crippled beggar, crawling through the streets and moaning pitifully in hopes of coaxing coins or food from the well-dressed passersby. Those who showed kindness soon found themselves victims of her ruse: in one swift motion, she'd spring to her feet, snatch their belongings, knock them down, and vanish into the labyrinthine alleys, leaving her pursuers cursing in the dust.\nSibylle was well aware of the brutal reality behind her actions. The food she stole was the reward for her speed, her cunning, and her ability to outwit the misguided compassion of the kind-hearted. A full stomach was the prize for her victory in a world ruled by survival of the fittest.\nAnd if the day ever came when she was too slow, or when her hiding place was uncovered and she was beaten to death by those she had wronged — just like the crippled black cat that once prowled the alley — Sibylle would have no complaints.

Like the raven, they were teary-eyed. With the same kindness she had shown the bird, Sibylle shared her modest meal of bread and water with them. However, once fed, they didn't leave. Instead, they forced their way into her home, taking what little food she had left and even her parents' keepsakes. Sibylle tried to fight back, but the children overpowered her, dragging her down and beating her until she was covered in bruises.\nSensing the danger, the raven flapped its wings and attacked the intruders, pecking at their heads in a desperate attempt to defend its home.

And I find Filthoids fascinating,\" the girl replied, glancing back, her eyes sharp. \"If you've read Maxima Flamel's Study of the Origins of Filthoids and the Charon People, you'd know what I mean... Oh, wait — you're here to study Claw Flowers, so you must've read it! That book mentions the Claw Flower as the oldest known Filthoid species.\"\nFlamel smiled but said nothing. They weaved through the rocky terrain of the western woods. As they neared a large boulder, the girl suddenly threw out her arm, halting Flamel. The still night air was suddenly split by the crackling sound of electric arcs across the space before them.\n\"The Claw Flower just retracted into the ground. If we had kept going, it would've killed us. But don't worry — it's stunned now. You can proceed with your investigation,\" the girl said, calm despite the sheen of sweat on her forehead. The effort had clearly taken a toll on her.\n\"Thank you,\" Flamel said, retrieving tools from her backpack. \"Since you've read the book, you know that the author's discovery of Helix proved all Charons share origins with Filthoids,\" she continued as she expertly dissected the Filthoid, storing its tissues in vials. \"Doesn't that frighten you? It's not just the Deteriorators — every Charon has Filthoid blood flowing through their veins. Including you.\"\n\"There's nothing to be afraid of. I don't care about what I was. I care about what I'll become,\" the girl replied, her violet eyes gleaming with determination. \"Besides, you can only master your power once you understand it.\"\n\"I'm finished,\" Flamel said, packing her tools. \"Thank you, this is a rare sub-species of Physalis Filthoid. Now, can you escort me to the nearest town?\" She paused. \"What's your name?\"\n\"Sibylle Mason,\" the girl replied.\n\"Very well, Sibylle Mason,\" Flamel smiled, her coat flapping in the valley's night wind. \"I have an address for you. If you're interested in Filthoids and the power of the Daimons, come to this residence and say your name. I'll be waiting.\"\n\n\"Blasted traitor! Sibylle, you told us to grab that woman, and now you're the one lettin' her go? What the hell are you tryin' to pull!!?\"\n\"Wasn't ten gold coins enough for you?\"\n\"But you said she was some big shot from the capital! Said we'd get a huge score! Now you're backin' out? If we're only gettin' ten coins, we shoulda just offed her and been done with it!\"\nThe two bandits, tied back-to-back on a rickety bench, thrashed and cursed as empty bottles rolled around them. \"Bloody hell! Only got the guts to act tough when we're out cold, huh!? You sneaky little rat, always the last to step up and first to chicken out. Just you wait — we're gonna kill you, like we killed that damn bird of yours!\"\nSibylle stood, rolling her eyes in disdain as she forced open the mouth of the loudest one. A deft twist, and a snap filled the air — the unmistakable sound of a jaw breaking. One by one, she stuffed the gold coins into their mouths, their curses turning to muffled gurgles.\n\"Morons. This is where your pathetic lives end. Mine is just beginning.\"\nClutching the scrap of paper Flamel had torn from her notebook, Sibylle turned and began her journey back to Dismania.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_43010404": "Sibylle believes she's a survivor of what can only be likened to hell.\nWhat does hell look like? It's an expanse of flames that surge towards you no matter how desperately you try to escape, engulfing everything. The scalding air seeps into your nostrils, viscous and oppressive, while it crackles and roars around your ears. \nAbove this fiery sea, any birds brave enough to soar are reduced to blind ravens, plummeting into the scorched earth, stirring ripples of flame.\n\nThis operation was meant to be highly classified. The commander had run through countless scenarios before departure, yet no one truly understood the defensive might at the heart of the enemy's stronghold — the Elysian Church.\nAfter three days and nights of contemplation, the commander decided to roll the dice. A small but elite team would be deployed via the Empire's newest airships, aiming for a swift, decisive strike at the core of the enemy to \"decapitate\" their force.\nIt seemed a desperate gamble, but also their best shot at victory. Thirteen Daimons, disguised as regular soldiers, were dispatched quietly as provisions to the front, embarking on what might well be a one-way mission.\nThough they were mentally prepared for the worst, it wasn't until they stood under the gaze of the divine that they truly understood the terror of facing the gods.\n\nBeams of searing light tore through the night, burning as they streaked across the sky like an eternal fire, devouring everything in their path.\nAt that moment, Sibylle stood on the brink of this inferno. The most she could make out beyond the blaze were charred branches, or remnants of what might have been wildlife — though she no longer had the strength to tell them apart.\nLucky for Sibylle, she wasn't part of the commando unit but was reserved as the last resort. If all went to plan, once the team reached the heart of the tower and completed their mission, she would extract them from the shadows before the enemy even realized what had happened. If the mission failed, she would rescue as many wounded as possible to minimize losses.\nBut what unfolded was far beyond their darkest expectations.\nOut of the thirteen Daimons deployed, twelve reached the target area. Two were critically injured by the horrifying beams of light upon arrival. The commander quickly assessed the situation and made the grim decision to leave them behind, leading the remaining nine deeper into the stronghold.\nSibylle understood the harsh necessity — abandoning the wounded was the only viable strategy in the face of overwhelming enemy strength. Had she been in command, she would have made the same call.\nBut unlike the commander, who didn't look back after giving the order, Sibylle, stationed as a last resort outside the battlefield, had to watch her comrades confront their fate.\n\nThe two injured Daimons, thanks to their resilient nature, managed to prop themselves up with their swords.\nAs the flames around them subsided, their laboured breathing eased slightly, and they no longer spat hot blood with every breath.\nBut as the fire faded, a battalion of heavily armed knights appeared. Their footsteps alone, echoing through the battlefield, spoke of their elite status — soldiers sent not to take prisoners, but to eradicate every intruder.\nOrdinarily, Daimons could scatter foes like rabbits before a hound, but incapacitated, they were helpless prey.\nGunfire tore through the air, shredding the already feeble defences of sword arcs and tearing through the bodies of the two soldiers.\nInitially hesitant, the knights advanced, growing bolder with each step. Within moments, they were close enough to drive their blades into the spines of the fallen.\n\nWatching this brutal scene unfold, Sibylle felt a surreal detachment. These were her comrades, soldiers who had trained alongside her mere days before. Now, they stood at death's door, as she watched from afar.\nWith their last strength, they leaned on each other for support. Whether by chance or intent, their eyes met Sibylle's, where she lay hidden in the shadows.\nSibylle's rational mind, honed by years of discipline, told her to obey orders, to let her comrades die. But deep within, a faint voice desperately protested.\nThey had never treated her poorly. Like her, they were fiercely loyal to the Empire, determined to earn glory, each burdened by their own troubled pasts. Many nights had passed in the dim barracks, filled with exchanges of stories about the past and dreams for the future. For someone who claimed to have no friends, these soldiers had come the closest.\nAnd now, these almost-friends stood before her, gazing at her as they faced death. \nBut what did their gaze mean? Was it a plea for help? Doubt? Resentment? Or something else entirely?\n\nSibylle knew she should ignore these thoughts. She had to follow orders without question, to snuff out the last remnants of emotion within her, emotions that shouldn't have existed in the first place.\nBut... could she? Could she stand by and let her comrades, her almost-friends, die?\nIn a futile attempt to escape the weight of her decision, she closed her eyes, hoping the nightmare would disappear.\nBut in that very moment, her comrades made the decision for her — they drew their daggers, and with grim determination, plunged them into each other's throats. No hesitation, no second thoughts, as if they had made this choice long before. Smiling, they fell.\n\nAs the enemy troops pulled back to pursue the deeper intrusion within the tower, Sibylle exhaled a breath she hadn't even realized she was holding.\nBlinking, she felt something unexpected on her face — a single tear, something no one had ever seen from her. She didn't know what the tear meant, just as she hadn't understood the meaning behind her comrades' final gaze.\nPerhaps it was a tear of relief that she no longer had to make such a cruel, agonizing choice. Or perhaps it was something else entirely.\n\n...\nThe mission was ultimately a success — though all but Sibylle and the commander perished.\nShortly after, Sibylle was promoted to legion chief, and she would forever refer to this operation as her \"survival from hell.\"",

Signalling misfortune had always seemed the raven's grim duty.\nDue to the secretive nature of the research at the Alchemy Academy, the institution's rooms rarely had windows. Instead, they were illuminated by constant, artificial light, like the pallid, perpetual sun of a land in eternal twilight. Yet Flamel had stubbornly insisted on having a window in her office. Perhaps it gave her a fragile sense of connection to the outside world.\nToday, however, the narrow window was overtaken by dark-feathered visitors.\nSitting upright at her desk, her hair meticulously coiled into a bun at the nape of her neck, Flamel ignored the knocking at the door. Her calm gaze remained fixed on the window, not sparing a glance for her visitor — her former student, the legion chief, Sibylle Mason.\n\n\"Ms Maxima Flamel,\" Sibylle's voice broke the awkward silence, \"I am here to formally notify you: due to actions considered an indirect betrayal of the Empire, your positions at the Spathatoi Alchademy, including your title as Chief Alchemist, are hereby revoked.\" Sibylle looked at her former mentor, speaking in a measured tone as she delivered the pardon she had painstakingly secured, having sacrificed her pride in the process. \"In light of your past contributions to the Empire, you will not be incarcerated in the Royal Military Prison. Should you choose to continue your research, you may retain a laboratory here, albeit under strict surveillance.\"\nFlamel remained silent. After a long, tense pause, she sighed deeply and finally turned to face her interlocutor.\n\"Is that all you have come to say, Chief Sibylle?\"\nSibylle averted her gaze, refusing to meet her mentor's eyes. \"Yes, that is all.\"\n\"The first time I met you, you were just a child. I was already your prisoner back then, much like today.\" Flamel's tone was calm. \"The kidnapping — it was orchestrated by you from the start, wasn't it?\"\nSibylle shook her head. \"There's no point in dwelling on the past, Ms Flamel. What matters is the present.\"\n\"The Alchademy was meant to be a sanctuary for the pursuit of knowledge, but you and Julius have turned it into a disgrace for the Empire.\" The ageing scholar met her former student's gaze, making one last, futile attempt to evoke some semblance of regret. \"Knowledge exists to make the world a better place. Yet you—\"\n\"I treat knowledge as a mere stepping stone to power,\" Sibylle interrupted, finishing the sentence for her. \"Yes, I remember your words. Your ideals are noble, and my pursuit of knowledge is disgraceful — I've never denied that. But has it ever occurred to you that having such lofty ideals is a luxury afforded only to those born into privilege, like you? Your life has always been filled with options and safety nets. But for the ravens on that windowsill? There are only two possibilities — to fly with all their might or be shot down by a child's slingshot.\"\nSibylle continued. \"And there's another thing you don't understand — ravens, too, have their ambitions. Once they fly high enough, they can see things that creatures tethered to the ground never will. And with that, they can do things no one else can — things that might truly change the world.\"\n\"Chief… no — Sibylle, tell me the truth!\" Flamel suddenly stood, knocking her chair to the floor. The ravens fluttered in alarm, taking flight from the window.\n\"That day, at the Tower of the Elysian Church — what did you see?\"\n\nSibylle remained silent, the setting sun slanting through the window, casting a glow on her face. For a brief moment, Flamel thought she saw something akin to divine grace in her student's expression — like a serene icon carved by Elysian artisans.\n\"Nothing, Ms Flamel,\" she finally spoke. \"Let's return to the matter at hand. If you wish to stay and continue your research here, just sign this agreement. You have three days to decide.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, Sibylle turned and walked away. She strode down the long, dimly lit corridors, never once looking back. Only when she was well out of sight, far removed from the office, did she pause. She turned around and bowed deeply towards the room.\n\"Farewell, Ms Flamel.\"",

This was how she remembered it: There was this really great, great priest — though his name escaped her — who was about to die of thirst in some desert somewhere.

There were nine of them, with skins like purple amethyst, flesh as green as the deepest forest, and juice as sweet as the very first morning dew.\nThis depiction was so entrenched in Truffle's mind that when she finally tasted real grapes for the first time, she was crushed by disappointment — so much so that she cried, leaving the well-meaning priests in a panic, utterly confused about what had gone wrong.",

A group of children gather around a long table, singing in harmony. Floating through this melody were the tantalizing scents of pies, rich mushroom soup, and thick slices of roast meat. The aromas danced and twirled with the children's joy, escaping through a slightly ajar window and drifting down to Truffle, who huddled beneath the window to avoid the falling snow, her nose and ears tinged red because of the cold.\nTruffle sniffled, possibly trying to catch more of those delicious aromas, or simply due to a runny nose from the chill.\nShe found herself humming along: \"Snowflakes drift, oh, lightly they fall, down the bustling streets...\" as if singing the same tune might somehow earn her a bite of the pie.\n\"That didn't work... I'm still so hungry...\"\nClutching her rumbling stomach, she picked up a dry twig and began to sketch in the shallow snow the foods her nose teased her with — roast chicken, doughnuts, and... the simplest of all, bread.\n\"I'd love some bread...\" Truffle mused, tracing the bread more vividly in the snow, believing that the more lifelike her drawing is, the stronger the scent would become — yes, it smelled so real, as if it were right in front of her.\nSuddenly, Truffle looked up and saw a loaf of bread floating in the air, just as she had imagined.

Truffle yearned to grow up, because growing up meant becoming strong enough to provide for herself. Hence, the symbolic filbert inspired the name for her one and only friend — Filbert.\nBut their separation came much sooner than Truffle had imagined. One day, while gathering mushrooms on a rocky cliff, Truffle slipped and fell. When she opened her eyes again, she found herself lying on a soft, warm bed, candles flickering high above, fresh air filling her lungs instead of the usual scent of earth — she was in a small room in the Elysian Church's sanctuary. It was Priestess McGuffin who had found her unconscious at the foot of the cliff and brought her here.\nA comfortable bed, clean bandages, fresh water, and clean food — these were luxuries that had only existed in Truffle's dreams.

She's my friend!\"\nBefore she could argue further, Priestess McGuffin interjected, \"Don't waste time, Truffle. You have to choose between staying here and staying with your pig.\"\nTruffle thought of that distant winter night when she huddled against a thick wall, overhearing the nursery rhyme sung by children snug in their home with their family.\nTruffle didn't have much time to decide.

It was then that Truffle realised the vast bounty that lay beyond the city's reach.\nSo, if the city's running out of food, why not gather more from the wild?\nTruffle shared her big plan with Filbert, and the inseparable duo embarked on their quest.\nThey reached the riverbanks, only to find them lined with people desperately trying to catch fish, but with little success.\nThey ventured into the forest, but even the bark and leaves of the trees had been stripped for sustenance.\nThey decided to give up on the quest to the cliffs, knowing all too well what awaited them there...\nIt seemed as though the whole world was starving. Fish, bugs, birds, and beasts — every creature was desperately consuming others in a futile bid for survival, only to fall, starve, and rot in the end...\nExhausted, Truffle collapsed under a tree that had been gnawed nearly to pieces.\nThe cold, hunger-stricken blur of that snowy night returned. Truffle felt so cold and hungry... and Filbert's form began to fade before her eyes...\nBut just then, Filbert, who was also defeated and worn out, suddenly perked up as she caught a scent. She scampered to a nearby tree and began digging with what little strength she had left.\n...\nA sharp, pungent smell filled Truffle's nostrils, rousing her from the brink of unconsciousness. There, just like before, Filbert was offering her something to eat.\nWith her considerable expertise in food, Truffle instantly recognised it was a Rubycap, a rare edible mushroom growing deep beneath the earth under trees. Due to their elusive nature and the effort required to unearth them, no one had yet attempted to harvest them.\nThough it tasted strange, as Truffle chewed the Rubycap, she felt her strength returning. Meanwhile, Filbert had already unearthed a dozen more under the tree.\nAs they hustled back and forth, the priestesses at the Church were astounded to find heaps of Rubycaps stacked high at their doorstep. They quickly ate their fill and began distributing the surplus to the famished townsfolk.\nBy the time green buds sprouted anew in the forest, the famine had subsided. Yet Truffle felt a twinge of sadness — she realised that with everyone now fed, there was no longer a need for her and Filbert to forage together, which meant she wouldn't be able to spend as much time with Filbert.\nFeeling downcast, Truffle wanted to ask Priestess McGuffin for her permission to play with Filbert for a few more days, but she didn't have the courage to voice her thoughts and ended up pacing back and forth outside the Church until she accidentally bumped into Priestess McGuffin, who was returning from town.\n\"I... um... about Filbert, er...\" Truffle fumbled for words, trying to articulate her small wish to the typically unsmiling priestess. To her surprise, Priestess McGuffin smiled, handing her a letter. Truffle read the letter, struggling to understand the fancy script:\n\"Beneath the sacred branches of the Heaventree... by the grace of the Great Nine... Truffle, child of this land... um, something something in times of need… the noble creature known as Filbert... who something at her side... Truffle is hereby bestowed the title Comm-something... Filbert... the Special Comm-something...\"\n\"I don't understand, Priestess McGuffin. What does this letter mean? It also says something about Filbert... oh, about her... can you please not send Filbert away? She really helped a lot... can you let her stay a little longer?\"\nPriestess McGuffin kept smiling as she knelt down to Truffle's level and said, \"The letter says that you and Filbert can stay together forever.\"\n\"Really!?\" Truffle's eyes widened in disbelief. \"Thank you, gods! Thank you, Priestess McGuffin!\"\n\"No, Truffle, it's us who should be thanking you and Filbert. You two are the greatest miracle I've ever seen.\"\n\nThough still not fully grasping the priestess's words, Truffle beamed with joy, for everything she had wished for had come true.",

Her smile often bears traces of bewilderment, with sporadic episodes of dizziness leading to brief spells of blindness.

However, since the door of this inn is hardly ever open to the public, few travellers in Icelake have had the chance to experience her hospitality. Yet, every morning, if you look up from the entrance of the inn, you can catch a glimpse of a slender figure shrouded behind branches and vines. That's Psyche busying herself: drawing back the thick drapes to let the flowers bathe in modest sunlight, gently misting the leaves, and meticulously pruning the wilted stems. Within the cold abode of the Hypnos' House, built from sombre grey stone bricks and pallid remnants of snow, it's only Psyche's flowers that bring a hint of warmth.",

Though she held dear the flowers she grew at home, she knew her parents needed them more than she did.\nThe flowers were salvaged by Psyche from below the stairs of the Hypnos' House. At that time, a lodger girl was throwing pots of plants sent from her parents out of the window while crying her heart out. After comforting that distraught girl, Psyche came to the pile of mess below the window alone, pruned the damaged stems and roots, collected the shattered pots, and painstakingly glued them back together. Under Psyche's meticulous care, those once nearly doomed flowers survived, flourishing even more vigorously than before.",

To outsiders, Psyche leaving home seemed quite odd — her parents were loving, and she had always been a good kid.

When pried, her mother remained silent and kept her composure, though her hands trimming the flowers trembled ever so slightly.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_53010204": "In Hypnos' House, Psyche stood out starkly among the other lodgers, a group of people marked for death before they even had a chance to truly live. Stripped of any future or hope, they spent their final days waiting for Henrik to release them from their misery. But Psyche was different. She always greeted everyone with a smile, as if her future still held promise. Her radiant smile pierced through the gloom and despair of the house, letting in a sliver of sunlight. For those long accustomed to darkness, that light was so blinding it forced them to confront the painful reality of life.",

That day, a heavy snowfall quietly erased every trace of the tragedy, as if it had never happened.\nHowever, the memories lingered for Psyche. For a long time, she was haunted by a recurring nightmare: a butterfly struggling to break free from its cocoon, only to collapse helplessly on the ground, unable to spread its wings.

It's just another preordained farewell. Everyone leaves eventually.\nShe thought she had learned to embrace farewells with calm acceptance. But she was wrong.

  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_53010401": "\"Psyche, time to get up.\"\nSix-year-old Psyche sprung from her bed — she'd long awaited this moment. Just the day before, her parents had at last given in, consenting to show her the ropes of flower care. The excitement had her wide-eyed all night.\nClasping her father's hand on one side and her mother's on the other, Psyche stepped into the flower shop. It was a fleeting summer, bright sunlight slanting through the windows with butterfly decorations, laying delicate butterfly-shaped shadows upon the petals, as if real butterflies had alighted among the blooms. Having imitated her parents in watering the last pot, Psyche, who had been up all night, was finally a little tired.\nSix-year-old Psyche nodded off on the balcony, lost in a cosy dream. In the dream, the gentle sun thawed Icelake's eternally frostbound earth, awakening a field of vibrant wildflowers. Amidst this floral tapestry, vivid butterflies flitted with grace. With arms outstretched, Psyche chased the beckoning sunlight and, alongside the butterflies, took to the whims of a mischievous breeze, gliding with abandon in the embrace of the sky.\n\n\"Psyche, time to get up.\"\nTwelve-year-old Psyche climbed out of bed. It was still dark outside, but she knew it was time to help out in the shop.\nSleeves rolled up, she accompanied her father to the deep well a kilometre away to fetch water. Returning to the shop with the morning dew still fresh, just as the horizon began to brighten, her mother had already boiled the water. Without even a moment to soothe their sore arms, Psyche and her father mixed the hot and cold water to just the perfect temperature before filling the watering cans — Icelake's well water was too cold for the delicate flowers, so they had to make sure their roots weren't harmed by the chill. After tending to the last pot of flowers and placing it on the plant stand, Psyche watched her parents open the shop windows and start another day of business before she waved goodbye and set off for school.\nAt twelve, Psyche understood why her parents did not want to teach her about flowers when she was younger — it wasn't a hobby or pastime for them, but a means of livelihood. Still, she loved those flowers. The opening buds would always put a smile on her face despite the cold and tiredness.\n\n\"Psyche, time to get up.\"\nSeventeen-year-old Psyche slowly sat up in bed. She tenderly stroked the worn blanket, hesitant to let go — it offered little warmth, and she wasn't really cold, yet parting with it felt unbearable. She knew it was her last night in this bed.\nHer mother wore a simple black dress, with heavy dark circles under her eyes and trails of tears on her cheeks.\nSeventeen-year-old Psyche extended a hand to neaten her mother's tousled hair. \"I love you, Mommy,\" she whispered, kissing away another teardrop of hers.\nThen, as always, she took her father's arm in one hand and her mother's in the other, heading towards the tall building in the north of the city.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_53010402": "\"Stay away from her!\"\nGrowing up, Psyche was all too familiar with this admonition, uttered by numerous adults to their children. Following such warnings, her newly made friends would be whisked away by them, never to appear again.\nYet, there was once an exception — a Mortalan girl her own age, whom Psyche chanced upon at the flower shop. That girl, brimming with curiosity about Psyche, would often ignore her servant's warnings and dash into the flower shop to find Psyche and play with her. She even invited Psyche to her grand mansion to play with her exquisite toy blocks together.\n\"See, this little one is me, and the one with horns, that's you...\" she said with excitement while arranging the blocks, \"and they're playing together...\"\n\"Don't you find my horns scary?\" Psyche asked timidly.\n\"Not at all, I think they are pretty!\" the girl replied without hesitation, \"Oh, right! Let's decorate your horns with some cute accessories!\"\nSpringing to her feet, she ran to the accessory cabinet and started to carefully go through a variety of ribbons and hair accessories: \"Hmm... this red one is cute, but it doesn't quite match your dress. What about this golden one...?\"\nAs she stood, her dress billowed, knocking over the horned figurine. Psyche noticed this, and she gently righted it to stand beside its little friend, then smiled.\n\"Psyche, which one do you like?\" the girl rushed back, thrusting a heap of colourful accessories into Psyche's arms, \"You can take anything you like!\"\n\"I—\"\nPsyche's words were interrupted by the creak of the door. The girl's mother — a well-dressed lady — entered the room, her face a mix of anger and disgust, as if she saw not a little girl in Psyche, but a dirty mongrel. What followed were the usual rebukes and curses that Psyche had grown accustomed to. As Psyche was driven out of the mansion, she heard the girl crying, \"Psyche, I'm sorry...! I'll go to your place and we can play together again!\"\nBut from that day on, the girl was grounded by her parents, even the windows of her room were locked and covered with opaque paper.\nPsyche knew it would end up this way, but she still felt that she owed it to the girl's kindness to at least tell her \"I would cherish anything you give me\".\nThese words lingered in Psyche's heart for many years until one day, she accidentally bumped into a lavishly dressed Mortalan boy on the street. Before she could apologise, a girl, also in fine clothes, pulled the boy away, \"How many times have I told you to stay away from those horned people! And you, you dirty Charon, are you blind? How dare you push my little broth—\"\nThe scolding abruptly ceased. The girl's gaze fixed on Psyche's horns, and her accusing finger awkwardly froze mid-air. Psyche recognised the girl — it was her wealthy little friend from the past, whom she had always felt beholden to.\n\"Psyche...? You...\" the girl was flustered, \"I...\"\n\"You've mistaken me for someone else, miss,\" Psyche offered an apologetic smile, \"I'm terribly sorry, I was a bit dizzy just now and didn't see your little brother.\"\nPsyche turned away and left. Those words she kept in her heart for years were ultimately discarded into the bin of time, just like those accessories and toy blocks she once touched.",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_53010403": "\"See you tomorrow, Psyche!\"\n\"Yeah, see you tomorrow!\"\nIt was just another evening. Psyche waved goodbye to her new Phoxhunter friend, watching {性别：him|her} leave Hypnos' House. It seemed like an ordinary farewell, but Psyche's gaze lingered on her friend's receding figure until {性别：he|she} disappeared into the night. She stood in the doorway for a long time afterwards, hesitant to return to her room.\n\"See you tomorrow\" — a phrase so casually spoken at every parting — carried a different, more poignant meaning for Psyche. Every night, as she closed her eyes, she wondered if she would truly be there to see a \"tomorrow.\"\nJust before drifting off, she'd whisper a silent prayer, hoping against hope to wake safely once more.\nAs the long night faded and dawn touched the earth, Psyche awoke. She slowly sat up, touched her arms, and felt reassured by the solid warmth of her human body, grateful for another day not transformed into a monster. \n\"Thank goodness,\" she thought with relief. \"I've kept my promise to {性别：him|her} once again.\"",
  "UI_CHAR_DATA_TEXT_53010404": "\"I'll ask you one last time, Psyche. Are you sure this is what you want?\"\nPsyche nodded firmly. She heard Henrik let out a long, heavy sigh. By now, her vision had blurred completely. Unable to see his face, she pieced together his image from memory.\nIn Psyche's earliest recollections of Dr Henrik, he was always sombre and distant, carrying a burden that seemed far too heavy for a man of his age, as if an old soul resided in a body still in its prime. Only when he glanced at the photograph on his desk did a flicker of genuine emotion briefly surface. Psyche had her suspicions about who the girl in the picture might be, but she never asked — she didn't want to pry into the grief he might have been hiding. Instead, she quietly placed a fresh flower in the vase on his desk each day.\nHenrik remained a man of few words, his life a steady repetition of simple, monotonous routines. Yet over time, Psyche noticed a subtle change — a spark seemed to grow in his eyes, like a sprout pushing through charred wood.\nOne day, Henrik unlocked an old bookcase. Years of dust billowed into the air, causing Psyche to shield her eyes. Peeking through her fingers, she saw Henrik coughing as he sifted through piles of old papers and notes, muttering words like \"blockade response\" and \"Crystallo of Stella.\" Although the technical jargon was lost on her, she vividly remembered his final whispered words:\n\"Hayley, I want to try it again... Do you think it could be a different story this time?\"\nFrom that day, Henrik locked himself in his office, working around the clock with phials, petri dishes, and all manner of colourful liquids. Psyche didn't interfere; she had never seen him so passionately pursue anything. Before, he had seemed like a distant, benevolent deity, merely decreeing the merciful end to suffering at the appropriate moments. Now, he was more like a man grasping desperately at hope, or a child chasing after a long-lost treasure. \nFor the first time, Henrik seemed thoroughly human.\n\n...\n\n\"Then drink this.\"\nHenrik's voice snapped Psyche back to reality. Something cold was pressed into her hand. Tracing its shape, she felt the rough surface of a small phial. As she cradled it, feeling its slight weight, she understood the life-changing significance it carried. This phial was the culmination of Henrik's relentless work, the product of countless sleepless nights. If fortune smiled upon her, this phial could free her from a hopeless fate. And if not... well, at least she would have helped Henrik refine his research and contributed to saving more lives, wouldn't she?\nShe couldn't help but picture the liquid inside — crafted from Crystallo of Stella, it must shimmer with a faint, ethereal glow. The thought brought a smile to her lips.\n\"{nickname} and I retrieved that piece of Crystallo of Stella together. I trust it will bring me good luck,\" she mused, hopeful.",

They were but fleeting figures in your journey, just as you were in theirs.\nEventually, you found yourself standing before a house on a rise, a place long abandoned in your memory.

  "WikiText_10100701": "An official academic institution of the Hyperborean Empire.\n\nAlchemists in Hyperborea were once akin to their counterparts across the continent — enigmatic figures detached from everyday life. This began to change under Queen Bellona Ⅱ, who founded the Royal Alchemy Academy and gradually redefined the role of alchemists within the Empire.\n\nOriginally a small scholarly organisation, the Academy gathered the Empire's brightest minds under royal patronage to pursue legendary goals, such as elemental transmutation for military use. Though such ambitions were never realised, centuries of research eventually led to the discovery of Phoxichor — an energy source as precious as gold, refined from Phoxene. This breakthrough marked the dawn of Phoxene technology and elevated alchemists to the forefront of national development. Over time, alchemists became synonymous with Imperial scholars, employed by the state to advance its industry, infrastructure, and military arsenal through Phoxene-tech applications. The Academy itself has since evolved into a vast network of research branches across the Empire's major cities.\n\nToday, the Academy is divided into two principal branches: the Aeolipile and the Spathatoi. The Aeolipile — also known as the Old Academy — continues the institution's original mission, focusing on mechanical invention, engineering projects, and weapons development powered by Phoxene-based technologies. By contrast, the Spathatoi, or New Academy, was founded by Emperor Julius I with support from the 13th Legion. It absorbed the Academy's former biological sciences and now leads research into life sciences, medicine, and Charon magic.",

  "voice_ch_char_Haier_vo_topic_01_3": "It does pose some challenges — I can only sleep on iron beds and can't linger in wooden structures for long. However, it allows me to pull criminals from burning buildings and administer justice. And the cold never bothers me.",

  "voice_ch_char_Heitao_vo_topic_04_1": "Well, that place is like a city made of steel... Mm, more like a prison, to be precise. I spent my early years there.",
  "voice_ch_char_Heitao_vo_topic_04_2": "Later on, along with you, I was taken away from there by someone, and we ended up on Purgatorio Island. I can't share much about her, though — Sorry, I promised her.",
  "voice_ch_char_Heitao_vo_topic_04_3": "...Life on Purgatorio Island was so peaceful, that I almost believed we could live that way forever. But it wasn't until the day they came for me that I realised I had never truly escaped that prison.",

Out there, living rough, you never know when it'll be your last, so we don't usually bother with celebrations.\nBut hey, since you're not from around here and spar with me every day, a celebration feels just right.\nThen — let today echo with songs of heroes! Let us sing for the young, brave Phoxhunter, bound by honour and promises worth their weight in gold!",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_companio_01": "They say the best swordsman doesn't even need a sword — anything, a blade of grass, a twig, can become a weapon. I heard you fight with cleaning tools. Guess that makes you a master of the blade too, huh? Mind showing me a trick or two?",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_companio_02": "I'm holding onto your old sword for now. When you stop moping around with that gloomy face, I'll give it back — but only if you beat me in a duel. Lose, and it's mine for good.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_companio_03": "A sword can be a friend, a toy, or even a tool for all sorts of things — cutting, prying, shaving. But it should never be your master. Don't let that blade hold you back.",

  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_01_2": "Honestly, it's been ages since I've met anyone truly on par with me. Though, my shifu always said I need more honing because I'm too blunt — and that I should work on my acting.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_01_3": "Not exactly how I see it, but he always said that swordsmanship isn't just about skill; it's about strategy. Stuff like \"conceal your strength by feigning weakness,\" \"subdue the enemy without fighting,\" and \"overwhelm the few with the many.\" Said that's what separates the good from the great.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_01_4": "Back when I was a kid, he used to pull that same trick on me. He'd claim his skills were mediocre and tell me if I could knock him down, I wouldn't have to train anymore. Took me a whole year to realize I couldn't even touch his sleeve.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_01_5": "One day, I was so wiped out I just collapsed. That's when I noticed — not a single drop of sweat beneath his feet. That doddering, clumsy look of his? All an act.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_02_1": "Plenty of reasons, really, but if I had to sum it up: I hate being bound by them.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_02_2": "I've been free-spirited all my life, doing everything my way, drawing my sword wherever I saw injustice. I only ever listened to what I wanted to hear from my Shifu or Yuming. The rest? In one ear and out the other, like the wind passing by. So tell me, why would I let myself be chained by some laws?",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_02_3": "I'd say it's the concern of a swordsman. Think of it this way — when you first learn swordsmanship, you follow the swordplay scroll move by move, right? Against regular foes, that's enough. Your sword moves instinctively.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_02_4": "But if you stick too closely to the scroll and can't think on your feet, your sword's no better than a lump of scrap — dull, clumsy, useless. Face something unexpected, and you'll flail around like a headless chicken.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_02_5": "To me, Huaxu is like a clumsy swordsman glued to their Nine Chapters of Dafeng. They can't even deal with a Drifter like me — what chance do they have against a true threat? It's only a matter of time before they fall.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_03_1": "Of course! Being good with a sword doesn't mean you're stuck using only it. In Huaxu, there are people who can use pens and chopsticks as weapons — does that mean swordsmen are supposed to starve or never write?",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_03_2": "Oh, I can do that. But why bother? Dodging is way easier, after all. Even boars in the woods know to go for radishes over tree bark when they can.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_03_3": "That said, if I ever meet a worthy opponent, you can bet I'll draw my sword and go all out.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_04_1": "They sure do. Now that you mention it, I can think of quite a few. Stuff like \"King So-and-So,\" \"Lord Something,\" or \"Immortal This-and-That.\" Animals are the go-to — dragons, tigers, lions, cranes, you name it. It's like a whole zoo out there.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_04_2": "Here's how it works: the longer the title, the lousier the skills. Four words? A newbie. Three? Not bad. Two — that's someone you don't want to mess with. And those with no nickname at all? They're the true grandmasters.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_04_3": "I walk this world with my real name, of course. I know, it sounds made-up, doesn't it? Even my shifu used to say so — warned me that a name like this would have people mistaking me for some prodigy, and that'd only bring me trouble.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_topic_04_4": "But it's the name my old man gave me. Maybe he hoped I'd grow up to be some kind of hero. He didn't leave much behind, but carrying this name feels like his sword still leaves its mark on the world.",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_victory": "A blade in hand to right all wrongs — who's next?",
  "voice_ch_char_Kezhou_vo_welcome": "Today's perfect for drinking and singing! Come on, let me finish this glass, and then we'll chase down the sinners who deserve my sword. What? I said the same thing yesterday? Well, every day's a fine day to live like this, don't you think?",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_appear": "Do I really have to go there this time?",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_battleidle": "I wish they could understand the value of taking a break like me.",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_battlestart": "Let's target the weak spot in their defences.",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_be_hit_heavy_r01": "That was brutal.",

  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_birthday": "I've been waiting here for ages, sacrificing my precious downtime, all so that I can give you an unforgettable birthday. I even upgraded your kitchen utensils and baked you a cake last night. It might not look like much, but I hope you like it. After all, it was quite a challenge for a baking newbie like me.",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_companio_01": "Reporting, Chief Sibylle. Today's tasks have been arranged. If you have any additional orders, I'm ready to carry them out. However, today was quite demanding, so you should take some rest to avoid burning out.",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_companio_02": "Great job on the last mission, but I've received some complaints about damage to public property... *sigh* I find it kinda awkward to apologise to people on your behalf... After all, I'm a bit shy. Soooo, lovely and kind-hearted Miss Lynn, could you handle these urgent tasks for me? Pretty please with a cherry on top!",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_companio_03": "Wha... How can this be? Maybe I'm just so tired that I'm seeing things now. Might as well file for a work-related injury and take a few more days off.",

  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_die_r02": "Falling into a deep sleep... isn't as nice as I thought...",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_fail": "The art of war also involves knowing when to withdraw! Sooo, I'm going now!",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_gain": "Hah, you got me. Looks like my easy days are over... Still, you seem like a decent sort, so I suppose I could lend a hand. In my own personal capacity, of course.",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_idle": "Hmm... This sneak folding shotgun could use an auto-fire upgrade, and if I give it more firepower... Then, we can take out our enemies even faster on our next mission and head home early.",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_lvup": "It may be irritating, but preparing before battle is never a waste of time.",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_revive": "Time to perk up. It's work time...",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_skill01_r01": "Hurry up and surrender.",

  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_topic_01_1": "My family? My parents haven't really fussed over me for years; just my sisters occasionally trying to boss me around. But now that I'm in the Legion, they're out of reach.",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_topic_01_2": "Oh, not at all! T-They're absolutely delightful, smart, kind-hearted, gentle, charming, beautiful, and just about perfect! Though, a bit more decorum would be nice...",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_topic_02_1": "Huh, you're one of those who don't appreciate a good rest! Listen up: Beds are havens, where souls find ease; rooftops sanctuaries, where anxieties cease. In afternoon gardens, the sunlight gleams; take a nap, and enjoy the symphony of sweet dreams...",

  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_topic_03_1": "She sure knows how to run you ragged... I'd need to split myself in three just to keep up... Ahem, I mean, Chief Sibylle is always perfectly strict with us.",
  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_topic_03_2": "...How about I treat you to some afternoon tea, and we pretend this conversation never happened? Don't worry, it won't be spiked.",

  "voice_ch_char_Landi_vo_topic_04_3": "Hey, I didn't finish! I drew up these plans during my precious breaks — do you know how hard it was for me to keep them from Chief Sibylle?",

But now, that dream will never come true...\nAh, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to spoil the mood with my rambling on such a joyful occasion... Please, don't let my words dampen the day.

  "voice_ch_char_Shuimu_vo_topic_02_2": "Hmm, how should I put it? ...It's like water in perfume, which kisses and embraces each ingredient, devours and absorbs their fragrance, and eventually blends with them to create a long-lasting aroma...",
  "voice_ch_char_Shuimu_vo_topic_02_3": "There's much more to that. I seek a love so profound that we become truly inseparable... Even if life itself ends, one will become the mulch for the flowers in our garden; the blooms will turn into perfume, lingering around the other for eternity.",

  "voice_ch_char_Shuimu_vo_topic_04_1": "I'm perfectly fine. My venom is part of me, like a gift from the God of Love — it's harmless to me, and will help me find my destined lover.",
  "voice_ch_char_Shuimu_vo_topic_04_2": "Of course. Though it often casts me as a monster, it also sets me apart. I believe that the destined lover meant for a monster must be quite special, don't you think?",

  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_gain": "Hellooo! It's me, the Commissary, Truffle, with my faithful followers by my side, Filbert and her family. That's it for my self-introduction. But I gotta say, your eyes look as big as saucers! You must be starving!",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_idle": "Let's take some rest, Filbert. Have some grains and nuts, and a few flowers for snacks. If you're full, I'll pin them to my hat for now.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_lvup": "An empty tummy won't get you far in battle. So gobble up some grub and prepare to charge towards victory!",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_revive": "Emergency food is gross... Well, at least it fills up my tummy.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_skill01_r01": "Gonna knock you flying!",

  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_skill02_r02": "The special Commissary's here. Feast till forever!",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_skill02_r03": "Gimme the food, or else I'll smash you.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_01_1": "Huh? You don't know? A commissary's job is to make sure everyone's well-fed, dealing with all sorts of food every day.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_01_2": "For example, I go out to gather all kinds of ingredients from the wild, have Filbert haul them back, and then get Mr Beard at the bakery to turn them into yummy food for everyone.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_01_3": "And just so you know, haggling with Mr Beard is part of my job too! Hehe.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_01_4": "Oh, not at all! The others seem to be brainy types; they're all about the paperwork — filling out application forms, then waiting for trains loaded with food to roll in.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_01_5": "But for a small town like ours, just Filbert and I can feed everyone! Otherwise, I might have to start filling out those forms too — ugh, it's all gibberish to me.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_02_1": "Hmm... maybe it does? I've never really thought about it, but Filbert only knocks down those no-good, shouty, fighty troublemakers! They totally deserve it!",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_02_2": "Those guys always end up hungry after their brawls. They'd do more good ploughing fields than swinging weapons — that way, less people would go to bed hungry.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_02_3": "Absolutely! Fighting just leads to hunger — that's really awful! I've heard that in times of war, everyone ends up starving, which is just the worst! I hope I never have to see that.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_02_4": "Right! Anyone who makes people go hungry will sooner or later get knocked over by Filbert!",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_03_1": "Yeah, she is! And you know what, even across several creeks, Filbert can sniff out ripe berries and then off we go charging! Pretty awesome, isn't she?",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_03_2": "No worries at all! Filbert always brings more food. So never ever make fun of her — it would hurt her feelings, and mine too.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_04_1": "Thank you! Actually, these are shorts, not a dress. They did start as a pretty, long, white dress; then the lady at the tailor's shop turned them into shorts for me.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_04_2": "Because dresses aren't the best for all the running around I do. One time, I tripped over the hem and all the bread in my arms went flying.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_04_3": "But if the day comes, when no one's starving anymore, I'll have them changed back into a dress!",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_05_1": "Oh, I was meditating, not zoning out. I'm a member of the Elysian Church after all, so I do try to give some deep thought occasionally.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_05_2": "I used to wonder about that, but the clergy said it was... blastphomy or something. So I stopped thinking about that.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_topic_05_3": "I never quite get what they say, like how gluttony is a terrible sin... but it seems like the higher someone's status, the more they eat.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_victory": "Let's have a celebratory feast! Erm... No, that'd be a waste of food.",
  "voice_ch_char_Songlu_vo_welcome": "The sun is shining bright, and the little birdies are chirping with joy after a hearty meal. Are you hungry too? Wanna grab something to eat as well?",

  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_be_hit_heavy_r01": "I'm fine.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_be_hit_heavy_r02": "Quite the tragedy.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_birthday": "Happy birthday, {nickname}. Thank you for inviting me.\nTo me, ever since I was cast off the stage, birthdays have become a bitter reminder of painful days gone by, like extinguished spotlights that will never shine again or old scripts crumpled and forgotten at the bottom of a bin.\nYet today, I find myself pondering what an ordinary birthday might be like — one composed of simple, warm moments that hold a special meaning only for those who are part of them: a handmade gift box with uneven edges, a cake slightly marred by a misplaced candle, and—\n...A birthday song sung by friends? You mean you'd like me to sing? Very well, but I must confess, I don't know the birthday tune of your homeland. You'll have to teach me first. Don't worry — I'm a fast learner.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_companio_01": "How have you been lately?\n...Apologies for the abruptness. We don't actually know each other. I was... merely enquiring for a friend.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_companio_02": "Is that so? You've found a new home and a family who cares for you... That's wonderful. You've broken free of your cage — what a brave soul you are.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_companio_03": "Miss, the music you play is truly captivating. May I ask the name of this piece?\nAh, an original composition of yours... Such an enviable gift. Might I have the honour of admiring the sheet music?",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_companio_04": "Your mimicry is extraordinary. Even the finest stage prop artists couldn't craft something so exquisitely detailed.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_companio_05": "I have no need for a mirror to continuously remind me of my own grotesqueness.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_die_r01": "My final act... is done.",

  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_lvup": "I have rehearsed for such moments countless times in the past.",

  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_01_3": "The wall between our cells was so thin, every sound passed through. There he was, barely a metre away — rambling about his family, spinning dreams of the future, or singing some hopelessly off-key tune.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_01_4": "For a moment, I'd forget I was a caged beast. Instead, I'd feel like an ordinary child in school, waking from a nightmare during an afternoon nap to the racket of a noisy classmate beside me.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_01_5": "...Heh. Perhaps.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_01_6": "But \"friend\" is far too bright a word for someone like me. We were more like two stranded fish, floundering together in a drying riverbed.",

  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_04_2": "When you're on stage, every part of you — from your very bones to the breaths you take — is surrendered to the character. In that moment, you can shed all your sorrows and pain, stepping into a world unblemished by reality.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_04_3": "But you... you were born the {性别：hero|heroine} of your own story, already carrying the admiration and trust of those around you. You shine effortlessly, needing no spotlight to dazzle.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_05_1": "It stands, enduring time far beyond my years. On one side of its towering walls lies the imposing inner city — majestic as storm clouds, yet colder.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_05_2": "Elegantly clad figures alight from silk-lined carriages, discussing art, poetry, and the perpetual gloom of the skies. They gossip about balls and betrothals, lamenting how the mire of melting snow from the outer city soils their fine leather boots.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_05_3": "On the other side of the walls, the rowdy fog district buzzes with chaos. Vendors hawk loudly, mothers clutch their children, begging for a scrap of rye bread. Mischievous hands sketch defiant graffiti, always a step ahead of the patrols.",

  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_05_6": "It's the velvet carpet that blanketed the stage after the curtain fell. As a child, after the earliest performance I can remember, my mother and I lingered on the stage after everyone left, reciting lines and dancing through the night.",
  "voice_ch_char_Tuosi_vo_topic_05_7": "When dawn broke, exhaustion finally overtook me. I lay down on that carpet, resting my head on Mother's lap, and drifted into a long, sweet dream.",

  "voice_ch_char_Xier_vo_topic_03_3": "If you've been feeling stressed, perhaps I could lend you a few. A little \"rat-a-tat-tat\", you might find it quite therapeutic.",

  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_01_1": "There is nothing that cannot be leveraged in a negotiation. The only question is — what price will move the scales in your favour?",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_01_2": "Indeed. Your life, mine, and the lives of countless others — each is but a piece on a grander board, their worth determined only by the stakes at play.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_01_3": "For those as insignificant as we, to exchange what little we have for what we desire... is that not, in itself, a stroke of fortune?",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_01_4": "Does my answer unsettle you? Then, by all means, prove me wrong.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_02_1": "Mmm... Never lose yourself in fleeting profits and losses. Play the long game. Be generous when needed. Learn to read people, to use them, and to grant them favours, so that they respect you, admire you, and also fear you. True power lies in that delicate balance.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_02_2": "Heh. Goods have fixed prices, but human connections are a different currency altogether. Those who haggle over every coin will remain forever bound to their little corner of the market. Only by mastering the art of influence can one rise above mere trade and ascend to true greatness.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_03_1": "I am often entangled in the minutiae of business, rarely afforded the luxury of leisure.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_03_2": "Yet, if fate were to grant me a fleeting moment of respite... I would likely seek solace in the theatre. Be it the age-old storytelling traditions of Huaxu, the refined operas of the Empire, or the avant-garde films gaining traction overseas — each offers its own intrigue.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_03_3": "Heh... No, I suppose not. Theatre distils fleeting moments of life, yet within those fragments, it unveils profound truths about the human soul — one that defies reason, thrives in contradiction, and remains endlessly captivating in its unpredictability.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_03_4": "So, what unexpected turns will you bring to my story? I shall be watching with keen interest.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_04_1": "Hmm? So, you've noticed. An old habit, nothing more.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_04_2": "When I was little, an accident left me stranded in a pitch-black ravine for three days and nights. It was then that this... tendency took root.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_04_3": "In this world, everyone harbours their own fears. I am no exception... You seem surprised. May I ask why?",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_04_4": "Heh... You're right. Weakness can be a merchant's undoing.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_topic_04_5": "I underwent rigorous training to suppress this fear. At the negotiating table, I can cast it aside with ease. But in your presence, there is no need for such pretences.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_victory": "A trifling matter, hardly worth mentioning.",
  "voice_ch_char_Zhiliu_vo_welcome": "Ah, so you've come to see me... Are you still resentful? Conflicted, perhaps? Or have you become indifferent toward me? It makes no difference. We have all the time in the world to figure it out."
